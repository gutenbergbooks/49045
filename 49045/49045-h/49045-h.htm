<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>An adequate exposition of Deuteronomy requires the
discussion of many topics. The author has endeavoured
to keep these various claims in view: at the
same time the limits of the volume have dictated selection
and compression. In particular, a chapter on miracle in
the Old Testament has been wholly omitted. That topic
cannot be said to have a peculiar or exclusive relation
to Deuteronomy. Yet the writer would have wished to
include in the volume a reasoned statement of the
grounds on which he owns and asserts the supernatural
in Old Testament history; all the more because he
admits critical views which have sometimes been associated,
and still oftener supposed to be associated, with
rationalistic views generally. For the present this discussion
is postponed. In some instances, also, the writer
has been obliged to content himself with statements
on critical questions more brief than he could have
desired; but it is hoped that enough has been said
to explain the position assumed, and to make clear the
main lines of argument.</p>

<p>The task of adjusting the matter to the space would
have been easier if it had seemed legitimate to omit the
critical and arch√¶ological questions on the one hand, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
on the other, to leave untouched the bearing of the
thoughts and Laws of Deuteronomy on the religious
history of the race, and on the dangers and duties of
our own age. But an exposition of Deuteronomy must
endeavour to open the appropriate outlooks in all these
directions.</p>

<p>Owing to the author's distance from London the work
of passing the book through the press has necessarily
been left wholly to others. It is hoped that oversights
which may have arisen from this cause will be pardoned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><i>THE AUTHORSHIP AND AGE OF DEUTERONOMY</i></h3>


<p>In approaching a book so spiritually great as Deuteronomy,
it might seem superfluous to allude to the
critical questions which have been raised concerning it.
On any supposition as to origin and authorship, its
spiritual elevation and the moral impulse it gives are
always there; and it might consequently seem sufficient
to expound and illustrate the text as we have it. Minute
and vexatious inquiry into details, such as any adequate
treatment of the critical question demands, tends to draw
away the mind, in a disastrous way, from the spiritual
and moral purpose of the book. That however is precisely
what the expositor has to elucidate and apply; and
so it might seem to be an error in method to enter upon
extraneous matters such as those with which criticism
has mainly to do.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this has to be taken into account.
The truth about the composition of a book, about the
authorities it is founded on, about the times in which and
the circumstances under which it was composed, if it
be attainable, often throws a very welcome light upon the
meaning. It clears up obscurities, removes chances of
error, and often, when two or three possible paths have
opened before us, it shuts us up to the right one. But if
that is the case when no special conflict of opinion has
arisen, it is much more so when a revolution of opinion
concerning the whole religious life of a nation has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
caused by the critical view of a book adopted by able men.
Now that is plainly the case here. Deuteronomy has been
the key of the position, the centre of the conflict, in the
battle which has been waged so hotly as to the growth of
religion in Israel. The attack upon the views hitherto generally
held within the Church in regard to that matter has
rested more upon the character and date of Deuteronomy
than upon anything else. Consequently every part of
the book has been the object of intense and microscopic
scrutiny, and there is scarcely a cardinal point in it which
must not be regarded differently, according as we accept or
reject the strictly Mosaic origin of the book as a whole, or
even of the legal portions. The difference is probably
never absolutely fundamental. On either supposition, as
we have said, the spiritual and moral teaching remains the
same; but the mind is apt to be clouded with harassing
doubt as to many important points, until clear views on
the critical question have been attained. This is felt more
or less acutely by all readers of the Old Testament who
are touched by recent debates, and they expect that any
new exposition shall help them to a clearer view. Many
will even demand that some effort in that direction should
be made; and, as we think, they rightly demand it.</p>

<p>But there is still another reason for dealing with the
questions gathering round the authorship and age of our
book, and it is decisive. The debate concerning the critical
views of the Old Testament has reached a stage at
which it is no longer confined to the professed teachers
and students of the Old Testament. It has filtered down,
through magazines first, and then through newspapers,
into the public mind, and opinions are becoming current
concerning the results of criticism which are so partial
and ill-informed that they cannot but produce evil results
of a formidable kind in the near future. By those who
are sceptically inclined, as well as by those who cling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
most closely to the teaching of the Churches, it is loudly
proclaimed that the acceptance of the critical view&mdash;viz. that
the Levitical law, as a written code, came into existence
after the Exile, and that Deuteronomy, written in the royal
period of Israelite history, occupies a middle position
between the first legislation (Exod. xx.-xxiii.) and this
latest&mdash;destroys the character of the Old Testament as a
record of Revelation, and undermines Christianity itself.
The former class rejoice that this should be so, and think
their scepticism is thereby justified. The latter, on the
contrary, reject the critical conclusions with vehemence.
They have found God through the Scripture, and, resting
upon this experience, they turn away from theories which
they believe to be in direct conflict with it. To write an
exposition of Deuteronomy therefore, without correcting
the false impression that the critical view as to its age,
etc., is incompatible with faith in a Divine revelation,
would be to miss one of the great opportunities which fall
to writers on the Old Testament in our day. Questions
regarding the age, authorship, and literary form of the
books of Scripture cannot ultimately be so decided as to
nullify the testimony borne to them by the experience
of so many generations of Christian men and women.
Whatever makes itself ultimately credible to the human
mind in regard to such matters, will always be capable
of being held along with a belief in the manifestation of
Himself which God has given in the history and literature
of Israel. But nothing will make that fact so readily
apprehensible, nothing will make it stand out so clearly,
as an exposition of a book like Deuteronomy, which takes
account of all that seems established in the critical view.
Even the most extreme critical positions, when separated
from the totally irrelevant assumption (which too often
accompanies them) that miracle is unhistorical, are compatible
with a real faith in Revelation and Inspiration. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
is not the fact of Revelation, but the common conception
of its method, which is challenged by the critical theories.
We shall therefore only try to meet a clamant need of
our time, if we take with us into the explanation of the
Deuteronomic teaching a definite conclusion as to the
authorship, age, and literary character of the book.</p>

<p>As regards authorship, the ordinary opinion still is that
Deuteronomy was written by Moses. This was the view
handed over to Christianity in pre-critical ages by the
Jews, and accepted as the natural one. But if the Mosaic
authorship of the whole contents of the other books of
the Pentateuch is now given up, much more should it be
given up in the case of Deuteronomy. For Deuteronomy
does not even claim to be written by Moses. It is not
merely that in it Moses is often spoken of in the third
person; that, if it were carried out consistently, as it is,
for instance, in C√¶sar's Commentaries, would be compatible
with Mosaic authorship. But what we find is
that the author, "whenever he speaks himself, purports to
give a description in the third person of what Moses did
or said,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> while Moses, when he speaks, always uses the
first person. The book, consequently, falls naturally into
two portions: the subsidiary, introductory framework of
statement, in which Moses is always spoken of in the
third person, together with the historical portions; and the
utterances of Moses himself, which these introduce and
hold together, and in which Moses always uses the first
person.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Again, wherever the expression "beyond Jordan"
is used in the portions where the author speaks for
himself, it signifies the land of Moab.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Wherever, on the
contrary, Moses is introduced speaking in the first person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
"beyond Jordan" denotes the land of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The only
exception is iii. 8, where at the beginning of a long
arch√¶ological note, which cannot have originally formed
part of the speech of Moses, and consequently must be
a comment of the writer, or of a later editor of Deuteronomy,
"beyond Jordan" signifies the land of Moab. If,
consequently, the book be taken at its word, there can be
no doubt that it professes to be an account of what Moses
did and said on a certain day in the land of Moab, before
his death, written by another person, who lived to the
west of the Jordan. The author must consequently have
lived after Moses' day; and he has taken pains by his use
of language to distinguish himself from Moses in a most
unmistakable way. It is no doubt possible, though not
probable, that Moses might have written of himself in the
third person in the connecting passages, and in the first
person in the remainder of his book: but that he should
have made the anxious distinction we have seen as to the
phrase "beyond Jordan" does not seem possible.</p>

<p>But if our book, as we have it, is not by Moses, but is
an account by another person of what Moses did and said
on a certain occasion, that fact has a very important bearing
upon the speeches reported as Mosaic. For the style of
the whole book up to the end of the twenty-eighth chapter
is, for all practical purposes, one. The parts where the
author speaks, and the parts where Moses speaks, are all
alike in style, and that style is in all respects different
from the style of the speeches attributed to Moses in
other parts of the Pentateuch. Consequently we cannot
accept the speeches and laws as being in the very words
of Moses. They may contain the exact ideas of Moses,
but these have manifestly passed through the mind and
clothed themselves in the vocabulary of the author of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Deuteronomy. Even Delitzsch is quite decisive on this
point.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the tenth of his <cite>Pentateuch Kritische Studien</cite>,
after distinguishing the Deuteronomist from Moses, he
continues thus: "The addresses are freely reproduced,
and he who reproduces them is the same who also
contributed the historical framework and the historical
details between the addresses. The same colouring, though
in a less degree, may also be remarked in the repetition
of the law in chapters xii.-xxvi. to which the book owes
its name. All the component parts of Deuteronomy, not
excepting the legal prescriptions, are woven through and
through with the favourite phrases of the Deuteronomist."</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the question immediately
suggests itself to what degree this representation of
Moses' legislation can be regarded as purely and unmixedly
Mosaic. Was this legislation given in the main
or entirely by Moses, and, if it was so given, may there
not be mingled with what he gave inferences drawn by
the author in whose style the book is written, and adaptations
demanded by the exigencies of his later times? A
full discussion of this point would, of course, be out of
the question here, and it would, moreover, be superfluous.
In Dr. Driver's article on "Deuteronomy" in Smith's
<cite>Dictionary of the Bible</cite>, and in his <cite>Introduction to Hebrew
Literature</cite>, detailed discussions will be found. All that
is necessary here is that one or two large and salient
aspects of the question should be looked at.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is important to know whether the
author of Deuteronomy can have been a contemporary of
Moses, or a younger contemporary of his contemporaries.
If he were, the relation between the speeches and legislation
in his book and that which Moses actually uttered
would be similar to that between the speeches of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
reported by St. John in his Gospel and the actual words
of our Lord. They might, in fact, be taken to be in all
respects a reliable, though not a verbal, representation
of what Moses actually said or commanded. If, on the
contrary, it should be proved, either from the character
of the legislation itself, or from the evidence we have as
to the date of the authorities whom the Deuteronomist
quotes, and upon whom he relies, that he must have lived
centuries later, then any such confidence would be
materially weakened. Now there can be no doubt, to
take the last point first, that Deuteronomy, taken as a
legal code, though not wanting in laws which have been
first formulated by its author, is mainly intended to be a
repetition and a reinforcement of what we find in the
Book of the Covenant (Exod. xx.-xxiii.). The result of
Driver's careful tabulation of the subjects dealt with in the
two codes is "that the laws in JE,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> viz. Exod. xx.-xxiii.
(repeated partially in xxxiv. 10-26) and the kindred section
xiii. 3-16, <em>form the foundations of the Deuteronomic legislation</em>.
This is evident as well from the numerous verbal
coincidences as from the fact that nearly the whole ground
covered by Exod. xx.-xxiii. is included in it; almost the
only exception being the special compensations to be paid
for various injuries (Exod. xxi. 18, xxii. 15), which
would be less necessary in a manual intended for the
people." This is also the conclusion of other scholars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and indeed is plainly demanded by the facts. It is, moreover,
what may be called the Biblical hypothesis, for
Moses is supposed to have been renewing the covenant
made at Horeb, and repeating its conditions.</p>

<p>But in the present condition of our knowledge, the fact
of Deuteronomy's dependence upon the Book of the
Covenant brings into view unexpected consequences.
It is true, certainly, that the laws of the latter code existed
before they were incorporated in the text where we now
find them. Consequently no verbal coincidences would
give us the assurance that the Deuteronomist had before
him the actual book in which these laws have come down
to us. But a conclusion may be reached in another way.
A comparison of the historical portions of Deuteronomy
with the corresponding narrative in the previous four books
of our Bible shows that for his history also the author
of Deuteronomy relies upon these earlier narratives, and
that he must have had portions at least of them before
him in the same text as we have now. The verbal
coincidences tabulated in Driver, pp. 75 f., as well as the
general and exact agreement in the events recorded in
Deuteronomy with those recorded in the earlier books,
show that the author has not only drawn his information
from the same sources as those of the earlier books, but
that he must have had before him at least that section
which contains the laws.</p>

<p>Now, as it happens, in the course of the analysis of the
Pentateuch it has come to be all but universally acknowledged
that Exod. xx.-xxiii. form part of a document
which can be traced, dovetailed into others, from Genesis to
Joshua, and perhaps beyond it. This document has been
called by Wellhausen the Jehovist document, and in all
critical books it is referred to as JE, as being made up of
two sections, one of which uses Yahweh for the Divine
name, and the other Elohim. The only generally known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
scholar who denies the existence of JE is Professor Green,
of Princeton in America, who, rightly enough, sees that
the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch cannot be held,
if these separate component documents are acknowledged.
But the separate existence and character of JE may be
regarded as demonstrated, and also that it has been
interwoven with another narrative, largely parallel, but
which deals of preference with priestly matters, and has
consequently been called the Priest codex, or P. Together
these make up the first four books of the Pentateuch;
and the remarkable thing is that, both as regards
law and history, Deuteronomy is dependent upon JE.
"Throughout the parallels just tabulated," says Driver,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
"(as well as in the others occurring in the book), not the
allusions only, but the words cited, will be found, all but
uniformly, to be in JE, not in P. An important conclusion
follows from this fact. Inasmuch as, in our existing
Pentateuch, JE and P repeatedly cross one another, the
constant absence of any reference to P can only be
reasonably explained by one supposition, viz. that when
Deuteronomy was composed JE and P were not yet united
into a single work, and JE alone formed the basis of
Deuteronomy." And this is not Driver's conclusion only.
Dillmann, who argues with splendid ability against Wellhausen
for the dating of P in the ninth century <small>B.C.</small> instead
of after the Exile, and consequently considers that it was
in existence before Deuteronomy, still holds that in general
JE is the Deuteronomist's authority both for law and
history, contenting himself with affirming that D shows
undoubted acquaintance with laws, etc., known <em>to us</em> only
in P. Clearly, therefore, Deuteronomy must have been
written after JE had been made public, or at least after
J and E had been written.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>The question therefore arises, what is their date? An
answer can be gradually approached in this way. As JE
reappear as an element in the Book of Joshua,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
contribute to it an account of Joshua's death and burial,
they cannot have been written by him, nor before his death.
That is the first fixed point. Then we may proceed a
step further. In various parts of JE there occur phrases
which cannot all be later glosses, and which imply
that the land, when the writer lived, had long ceased to
be in possession of the Canaanites, if some of them do
not even presuppose a time when the original inhabitants
had been absorbed into Israel, as Solomon attempted to
absorb them by making them slaves of the State. Such
passages are Gen. xii. 6, "And the Canaanite was then in
the land"; Gen. xiii. 7, "Moreover the Canaanites and the
Perizzites dwelled then in the land"; Gen. xl. 15, in
which Joseph says of himself, "I was stolen away out
of the land of the Hebrews," a name which the country
could not have acquired till some little time at least after
the conquest. Further, in Numbers xxxii. 41, which
belongs to J or E, probably the latter, we have an account
of the rise of the name Hawwoth Jair. Now in Judges
x. 3-5 we are informed that the Jair from whom the
Hawwoth Jair had their name was a judge in Israel after
the time of Abimelech, who made new conquests for his
tribe east of the Jordan. Unless, therefore, the unlikely
hypothesis be accepted that both the district bearing this
name in Judges and its conqueror are other than those
mentioned in Numbers, the verse brings down JE at least
to the period of Abimelech, which Kautzsch in his <cite>View of
the History of the Israelites</cite>, appended to his translation
of the Old Testament, states as about 1120 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.e.</i> two
hundred years after the Exodus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>The next step is suggested by Gen. xxxvi. 31-39, a
passage from JE in which a list of Edomite kings is given
with this heading: "These are the kings that reigned in
the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the
children of Israel." That sentence clearly cannot have
been written before kings arose in Israel; consequently JE
must be later than the days of Saul, and probably than
David, since the Israelite kingship appears to the author's
mind here as a firmly established institution. The author
of Deuteronomy must have lived and written at a still
later date, and we are thus gradually brought down to
the time of Solomon, or perhaps even later.</p>

<p>And the literary indications of date confirm this conclusion.
For instance, two books are quoted occasionally
in JE as authorities, which must consequently have
existed before that work&mdash;the Book of the Wars of Yahweh
(Numb. xxi. 14, 15), and the Book of Yashar (Josh. x. 12 f.).
The former has indeed been declared by Geiger to be the
product of false punctuation; but soberer critics have
accepted it and date it in Solomon's day. However that
may be, there can be no doubt that the latter actually
existed, and was probably a collection of songs, since from
it the verses describing the standing still of the sun and
moon are quoted. But we learn from 2 Sam. i. 18 that
David's beautiful lament for Saul and Jonathan was
contained in this book, and was quoted from it by the
sacred historian. The book must therefore have been
compiled, or at least completed, after David's lament. As
it was manifestly a compilation, and the poems it contained
may have been of very various ages, much stress in our
search for dates cannot be laid upon it. It is still of
some weight, however, that this post-Davidic book is
quoted by JE; so far as it goes, that fact confirms the
conclusion arrived at from other indications.</p>

<p>In the same way, the linguistic indications, though not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of themselves conclusive, point towards the same period.
It is, of course, true that we are as yet far from having
a general agreement as to the history of the Hebrew
language. That can only be established along with the
history of the Hebrew literature and the Hebrew people;
and perhaps we never shall be able to fix any definite
stages in the growth and decay of the language. Nevertheless
no careful reader of JE will deny what Professor
Driver says regarding them: "Both belong to the golden
period of Hebrew literature. They resemble the best
parts of Judges and Samuel (much of which cannot be
greatly later than David's own time); but whether they
are actually earlier or later than these, the language and
style do not enable us to say. There is at least no
<em>archaic</em> flavour perceptible in the style of JE."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> That
is an admirably balanced judgment, and we may rely
upon the indication it gives as an additional confirmation
of what we have already seen to be probable.</p>

<p>It is impossible that these various lines of inquiry
should converge, as they have done, towards the early
centuries of the kingship as the date of JE, if Moses had
written Deuteronomy, in which JE is drawn upon at every
moment. We may consequently dismiss that view finally,
and admit that the author of Deuteronomy cannot well have
written before the middle of the kingly period. But we have
still to inquire what the character of the Mosaic speeches
and the Mosaic writings given in Deuteronomy is in that
case. Had the author lived and written near the time
of Moses, we might, as has been said, have accepted them
as the Church generally accepts the Johannine speeches
of Christ. But if the Deuteronomist wrote four, or
five, or six centuries after Moses, what are we to say?
In one view it must be granted that his account may
be as accurate as if it had been written within fifty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of Moses' death. For an author of our own day, by
keeping close to original written authorities, and strenuously
endeavouring to keep out of his mind any information he
may have as to later times, may reproduce with marvellous
correctness the actual state of things, as regards law and
other departments of public life, which existed in England,
say, five hundred years ago. Similarly the author of
Deuteronomy <em>may</em> have handed on to us, without flaw or
defect, the information as to Moses' sayings and doings in
the plains of Moab which he had received from the written
accounts of Moses' contemporaries. He may have done so;
but when we consider that his authorities may have been in
part not much earlier than his own time, that the critical
sifting of history was then unknown, and finally and
most important of all, that the Deuteronomist has hortatory
much more than purely historical aims, we cannot
evade the question whether a good deal that is here set
down to Moses may not turn out to be additions to and
deductions from the original Mosaic germs of law, made
by inspired law-givers and prophets who took up and
carried on Moses' work. Many assert that this is so, and
we must face and try to settle the question they raise.</p>

<p>The theory held by those who most strenuously deny
this assertion is that all the laws in the Pentateuch are
Mosaic in the strict sense, that the codes were given by
Moses in the order in which they now stand in the
Pentateuch, and that they were enacted with all their
modifications in a period of not more than forty years, all
of which was spent in the desert. In order to ascertain
whether this view is tenable, we shall take one or two of
the more important matters, such as the place of worship,
the agents of worship, and the support of the cultus;
and we shall compare the provisions of the various codes in
order to see whether they can be supposed to belong to
so short a period, or to have been all enacted by one man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us take first the place of worship. The three codes&mdash;that
called the Book of the Covenant (Exod. xx.-xxiii.),
that contained in Leviticus and Numbers and called the
Levitical code, and that in Deuteronomy&mdash;all contain
directions about this. In the first the prescriptions are
(Exod. xx. 24): "An altar of earth shalt thou make to Me,
and thou shalt sacrifice upon it thy burnt offerings and
thy peace offerings, thy sheep and thy oxen. In every
place where I cause My name to be remembered I will come
unto and bless thee." In the Levitical law "the altar"
is to be of Shittim or acacia wood overlaid with copper,
and the place for it is to be in the court of the Tabernacle.
There all sacrifices are to be offered, and thither every
slaughtered animal is to be brought (Lev. xvii. 1 ff.), and
this is to be a statute for ever unto them throughout their
generations. In Deuteronomy again (chap. xii.) it is
enacted that all sacrifices are to be brought "unto the
place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all
your tribes to put His name there," and ver. 21, "If the
place which Yahweh thy God hath chosen to put His
name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of
thy herd and of thy flock" and eat them as game was
eaten without bringing it to the Sanctuary. But Moses
is not represented as ordering this law to be introduced
immediately. It is only when they go over Jordan and
dwell in the land which Yahweh their God giveth them,
and when He giveth them rest from all their enemies
round about so that they dwell in safety, that they are to
do this. Nay, according to ver. 20 the new order is to
be fully introduced only when Yahweh their God shall
enlarge their border as He had promised, <i>i.e.</i> when their
boundaries should be (xi. 24) the wilderness on the
south and Lebanon on the north, the Euphrates on the
east and the Mediterranean on the west. Now these
boundaries were attained only in David's day, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
rest from all their enemies round about was, as Dillmann
says, given as a matter of fact only in the times of David
and Solomon (cf. 2 Sam. vii. 11 and 1 Kings v. 18), notwithstanding
Josh. xxi. 42. Consequently the Temple at
Jerusalem must have been the place referred to. This is
distinctly the view of 1 Kings iii. 3 and viii. 16. The
latter passage is peculiarly emphatic. Solomon says, at
the dedication of the Temple, "Since the day that I
brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no
city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house that
My name might be therein." The Deuteronomic view
consequently is that the law requiring sacrifice at <em>one</em>
sole altar was intended by Moses to be enforced only
after the Temple at Jerusalem had been built.</p>

<p>These are the provisions of the three codes. Can they
have been the successive ordinances of a man legislating
under the influence of Divine inspiration within a period of
less than forty years? Let us see. The first legislation
was given at Sinai, in the third month after the Exodus:
the Levitical legislation on the matter was given about
nine months later when the Tabernacle was finished,
and during that time they had not removed from Sinai:
thirty-eight years afterwards the Deuteronomic code was
given in the plains of Moab. Let us look at the character
of the legislation given first of all at Sinai. The
meaning of the decisive phrase, "In every place where I
cause My name to be remembered I will come unto thee
and bless thee," has been much discussed; yet taken as it
stands, without reference to laws which on any supposition
are later, it cannot mean that sacrifices were to be offered
only at one central shrine. It specially provides for
sacrifices being offered at different places, but restricts
them to places which Yahweh Himself has chosen. At
every such place He promises to come to them and bless
them. So much, men of all schools admit; difference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
opinion arises only as to whether these places are meant
to be successive, or whether they may be simultaneous.
The view of those who accept all the legislation of the
Pentateuch as Mosaic in the strict sense is that the
places could only be successive, since otherwise the words
would imply that originally worship at one altar was not
prescribed. Delitzsch, for example, maintains that these
words imply necessarily only this, that the place of
sacrifice would, in the course of time, be altered by
Divine appointment, and he declares that to be their
meaning. Others, again, suppose that the command was
meant only to justify worship at the various places where
the Tabernacle was called to halt on the people's journeyings,
whether in the wilderness or in Palestine. Now
it cannot be denied that only on some such interpretation
can Exodus be brought into harmony with Leviticus,
and that undoubtedly has influenced, and rightly so, the
scholars who take this view. If it were tenable it would
be by far the most satisfactory interpretation. But it can
hardly be considered tenable if we look at the time at
which this law was given. There was as yet no other
law, and this was given as soon as the people came to
Mount Sinai. The law in Leviticus was not on any
supposition given till nine months later. Now, if
Exod. xx. 24 was meant for immediate use only, and was
superseded by the Levitical law after so short a time,
it is difficult to understand why it was given, and still
more difficult to conceive why it was preserved. In any
case it cannot have been understood to command worship
at only one place. It could have no other sense than that
the people, so long as they were at Sinai, were to sacrifice
only at Sinai where Yahweh had revealed Himself, or
at other places in the neighbourhood which He should
sanctify, or had sanctified, by revealing His presence at
them. At any such place, if there He had once revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Himself, He would continue to meet them. Without the
colour thrown upon them by succeeding laws, that is
surely the only meaning that <em>could</em> be put upon the words,
and so understood they undoubtedly authorise sacrifice
at two or more places simultaneously. If, on the other
hand, this law was meant more for the future than the
present, as some of the laws in the Book of the Covenant
undoubtedly were, it must have been intended to be in
force concurrently with Lev. i. f. But if so, the "places"
it refers to cannot be the mere halting-places on the
wilderness journey. No doubt these were determined
by Yahweh, and the tabernacle was set up at places He
may be said to have chosen, but the places themselves
were of no consequence at all. The Divine presence
is declared to be always in the Tabernacle. That was
certainly a place where Yahweh caused His name to be
remembered, and without further inquiry about place, the
men of Israel knew that He would always meet them and
bless them in sacrifice there. The different character of
the altar in the Book of the Covenant too, a mere heap
of earth or unhewn stone, and that in the Tabernacle,
made of acacia wood overlaid with copper, corroborates
the view that the altar aimed at in Exod. xxiv. is not
the Tabernacle altar. The only coherent view, on the
supposition of the concurrence of the two laws, is therefore
that while, as a rule, sacrifice was to be offered at
the Tabernacle, yet if the people came to any place where
Yahweh had caused His name to be remembered, sacrifice
might be offered there on an altar of earth or unhewn
stone, as well as at the Tabernacle. Either way therefore
there is permission to worship at more than one
place. But then the difficulty is that Leviticus appears
to denounce upon pain of being "cut off from the people"
absolutely every sacrifice not offered at the Tabernacle.</p>

<p>Now if so far matters have been far from clear on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
traditional supposition of the date and order of these
codes, a glance at Deuteronomy will produce absolute
confusion in every mind. As we have seen, Deuteronomy
represents Moses as restricting sacrifice most rigorously
to one altar after the building of the Temple at Jerusalem,
but virtually declaring that worship at various shrines
was to be blameless until that time. We have also seen
that that is the view taken by the author of the Book
of Kings. Now this might be regarded as a temporary
relaxation of the law, intended to meet the difficult circumstances
of a period of war and conquest, were it not for
one thing. That is, that Moses in Deut. xii. 8, after
prescribing worship at one altar, adds, "Ye shall not do
after all that <em>we</em> do here this day, every man whatsoever
is right in his own eyes," and as if to render mistake as
to the meaning impossible, in ver. 13 he explains ver. 8
thus: "Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy
burnt offerings in every place that thou seest." Notwithstanding
the efforts of conservative scholars like Keil and
Bredenkamp to explain ver. 8 as a reference to the intermissions
in, <i>e.g.</i>, the daily sacrifice, brought about by the
desert wanderings, or to the arbitrariness and illegality
of the generation which had brought judgment upon
themselves by refusal to obey Yahweh in attacking Canaan,
it still seems impossible to accept that view. Of course
if we knew that Moses was the giver of all these laws,
these words would have to be explained away in some
such fashion. But if they are approached by an inquirer
seeking to discover whether they all are Mosaic, sound
exegesis demands that they should be taken as Dillmann
and others take them. In the plain sense of words
Moses here admits that, up till the time at which he is
speaking, sacrifices were offered wherever men chose, and
that he had participated in the practice. And observe,
he does not refer to the Levitical law. He does not say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this conduct of ours is a sin which we must repent of
and turn from at once. He calmly permits this state
of things to continue after Israel is in Canaan, and looks
forward with equanimity to its continuance till the Temple
shall be erected in Jerusalem. With this passage before
us we ask, Can this be the same inspired legislator who
thirty-eight years before compelled sacrifice at one central
altar on pain of death?</p>

<p>The traditional hypothesis being thus encompassed
with difficulties, students of the Old Testament have
sought another which would correspond better with all
the data. Relying upon the fact that the author of
Deuteronomy founds his book almost entirely on JE,
and that if he knows some of the laws and some of the
facts mentioned in P only, there are no proofs that he
knew that book as we have it, they put it aside in
this matter also. Immediately, when that is done, light
breaks in upon our problem. If we take Exod. xxiv. 20
in the natural sense given to it above, sacrifice at various
altars was permitted from Sinai onwards, the only limitation
being that there should have been, at the place
chosen, authentic proof of a theophany or some other
manifestation of the Divine presence. That is the state of
things out of which Moses speaks in Deuteronomy. It will
be noticed, however, that there is a slight contradiction
of Exod. xx. 24. The Moses of Deuteronomy speaks as
if every man's arbitrary choice had been his only guide.
Probably, however, with his mind full of the stringent unity
he desires to see, he speaks hyperbolically of the looseness
of the former law, and means nothing else than the
practice prescribed by it. In all ways this view is supported
by the history. From the patriarchs till the time
of Samuel, the practice was to sacrifice at various altars.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Consequently, according to both the Book of the Covenant
and Deuteronomy, and according to the history,
the worship of Yahweh at sacred places throughout
the land was legal, until the Temple was erected at
Jerusalem. The centralisation of worship was, consequently,
a new thing when the division of the kingdoms
took place, and was not an express law till Deuteronomy.
If that book was not written till perhaps Hezekiah's day,
the fact will account as nothing else will do for Elijah's
words (1 Kings xix. 10), "The children of Israel have
forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and
slain Thy prophets with the sword." Even in the
presence of Yahweh he, without rebuke, calls the altars
in the Northern Kingdom His.</p>

<p>The first attempt we know of to centralise worship was
made by Hezekiah; a second and more strenuous attempt
was made under Josiah, but the work was not actually
accomplished till after the Return from the Captivity. All
the facts taken together suggest that the movement towards
centralisation was an age-long development. At first
all holy places might be sacrificed at, though a certain
primacy belonged to a central sanctuary, and this may
have been stamped by Moses with approval. When the
Solomonic Temple was built the primacy began to take the
form of a claim for exclusive validity. The experiences
in both kingdoms strengthened that claim, by showing
that if Yahwism was to be kept pure the worship at the
High Places must be abolished. The inspired writer of
Deuteronomy then completed Moses' work by embodying
that which had been always a tendency of the Mosaic
system, and had now become a necessity, in his revisal of
the Mosaic legislation. This was adopted by the nation
under Josiah, and the Priest Codex must in that case
represent a later stage of the development, when the
centralisation was neither a tendency nor a demand, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a realised fact. Such a process accounts much better
for the facts than the traditional belief; and though it is
not free from difficulties it at least releases us from the
confusion of mind which the ordinary supposition forces
upon us.</p>

<p>The inquiry as to the agents of the cultus need not
detain us so long. In the Book of the Covenant no
priests are mentioned at all. The person addressed, the
"thou" of these chapters, which is either the individual
Israelite or the whole community, has been held by some to
indicate that the individual offerer was the only agent in
sacrifice. But that is to press the word too far. Even in
Leviticus, while the whole people are addressed, the actions
enjoined or prohibited are such as are done by "any man
of them," and in Deut. xii. 13 we have precisely the
same expression, "Take heed to thyself that thou offer
not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest,"
used at a time when there was undeniably a priestly tribe
and even the High Places had a regular priesthood. But
while in Exod. xx.-xxiii. there is no evidence to show
whether a priesthood existed, in the previous chapter
(xix. 22, 24) priests who "come near to Yahweh" are
twice mentioned. This would be a fact of the first importance
were it not that the words occur in a passage
which is admitted to be in its present shape the work
of the later editor. Dillmann maintains, and with good
reason, that he has inserted and adapted here a fragment
of J. If so then J may have held the view that there were
priests before Sinai was reached, but under the circumstances
we cannot be certain that the mention of them
may not be an anachronism introduced by the later hand.
In favour of the view that it is so is the fact that in the
account given by JE of the ratification of the Covenant
between Yahweh and the people (Exod. xxiv. 1 ff.), Moses
erected an altar and then "sent the young men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the children of Israel which offered burnt offerings and
sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto Yahweh." He
himself however performed the specially priestly act of
sprinkling the blood upon the altar. Had there been
priests or Levites accustomed to perform priestly functions,
we should have expected them to act, instead of "the
young men of the children of Israel." But, on the other
hand, we must not omit to notice that the Levites occupy
in all these transactions, as narrated by JE, a very prominent
position. Dillmann,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> as we have seen, separating
J and E, considers that the passages in which priests
before the Sinaitic legislation are spoken of belong to J,
and adds: "Indeed, it appears from Exod. iv. 14, 'Is not
Aaron the Levite thy brother?' and xxiv. 1, 9, that for
him even then the Levites were the priestly persons."
To these passages Driver adds Exod. xviii. 12: "And
Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and
sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of
Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God."
Further, Nadab and Abihu are Levites, nay, sons of Aaron,
and in Exod. xxiv. 1 and 9 they go with Moses, Aaron,
and the seventy elders as the complete representation of
the people, and Moses, himself a Levite, performs all the
greater priestly acts.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Moreover JE knows of the ark,
and speaks frequently of the "tent of meeting" (Exod.
xxxiii. 7 ff.; Numb. xi. 24 f., xii. 4 ff. and Deut. xxxi.
14 ff.). But a very notable thing in connection with the
inquiry as to the performers of priestly duties appears in
Exod. xxxiii. 7 ff., where E's account of the "tent of
meeting" is given. When Moses turned again into the
camp "his minister (<i>mesharetho</i>) Joshua, the son of Nun,
a young man, departed not out of the tent," yet Joshua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
was an Ephraimite (1 Chron. vii. 22-27). In Exod. xxxii.
29, however, the same authority describes the consecration
of the Levites to the priesthood, after the apostasy of the
golden calf.</p>

<p>In Deuteronomy, on the contrary, the priests are very
prominent; they are called, however, the Levitical priests,
or priests simply, but never sons of Aaron. The whole
tribe of Levi is regarded as priestly in some sense. They
constitute, in fact, a clerical order, though there are clear
indications of ranks, of men being assigned to special
duties. Curiously enough, the tribe thus highly honoured
is spoken of as being notoriously and all but universally
poor. No sacrifice can legitimately be offered without
them; and, though the question of the place of sacrifice has
not yet been finally settled, the position of the Levitical
priests as sacrificers is so entirely established that it is
regarded as needing neither assertion nor justification.
Nay, in one passage, Deut. x. 6&mdash;which there is no
valid reason, except the wish to get rid of its contents,
for supposing to belong to another authority than D<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;the
hereditary succession to the chief place among the priesthood
is assigned to the family of Aaron. In xviii. 5 also
the hereditary character of the priesthood is asserted in
the words, "For Yahweh thy God hath chosen him&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the priest&mdash;out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in
the name of Yahweh, <em>him and his sons for ever</em>." As for
the body of the Levites, their position is somewhat ill-defined.
On the authority of xviii. 6 ff. many claim that
at the date of Deuteronomy every Levite was, at least
potentially, a priest, that in fact Levite and priest were
synonymous. But, as will appear in the exposition of the
verses referred to, that is a very questionable proposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Nevertheless it cannot be denied that in Deuteronomy the
line between priests and Levites is a very indistinct one;
there is <i>prima facie</i> reason to believe that it could be
passed, and the gap between the two is certainly not nearly
so wide as it appears to be in the undeniably post-exilic
literature.</p>

<p>In the Priest Codex again, the priesthood is confined
exclusively to the house of Aaron, with the high priest
at their head. The Levites have no possible way of
entrance into the priesthood. They are Yahweh's gift to
the priests, and are confined most strictly to the duty of
waiting upon these in the ministration of the Sanctuary.
They have none but the most subordinate share in the
sacrifices; they are shut out from the holy places of the
Tabernacle; and they have assigned to them cities in
which they may dwell together when they are not on
duty at the Sanctuary. There is no word there of Levites
being poor, and altogether the position of the tribe is,
through the priests, much more dignified and prosperous
in a worldly sense than we found it to be in Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>Now, taking all these data together, we find here, just
as we did in the previous section, that the Levitical law
is a disturbing element between Exodus and Deuteronomy.
If we take it out of the way, J, E, and D harmonise well
enough. The main difference is that the latter shows
the same fundamental conditions as we find in the former,
only consolidated and developed by time, but by a longer
time than forty years. In fact D makes explicit that
importance of the Levites which is only hinted at and
foreshadowed in JE. They have come to be the only
authorised agents of sacrifice; they have a hereditary
headship in the house of Aaron; various orders and
degrees must be held to exist (cf. Deut. xviii. 1 ff.).
Compared with this state of things, the Levitical arrangements
of P, supposed to have been given thirty-eight years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
before, are very different. In every respect they are more
definite, more detailed, and show a much more differentiated
organisation than those sketched in Deuteronomy.
These latter indicate a state of matters which would suit
admirably as an embryonic stage of the full-grown
Levitical system, and which can hardly be fitted into
their place otherwise.</p>

<p>It is suggested, in reply, that allusions in Deuteronomy
<em>imply</em> the existence of a system of a much more elaborate
kind than any that we could construct from the explicit
statements of the book, and that is certainly true. But
no reasonable interpretation of these allusions can lead
us to a system identical with that in P. Nor can Deuteronomy's
use of the name Levites (though undoubtedly
it has been pressed by some too far) be held to be consistent
with the public recognition of the "great gulf
fixed" in P between the Aaronic priests and the Levites
as a body. Nor will the fact that Deuteronomy is the
people's book, and is consequently not called upon to go
into technical details, cover the difference. Indeed nothing
will, short of recognising the fact that, as publicly acknowledged
organisations, the tribe of Levi in P and the tribe
of Levi in D are different, and that the state of things in
D's day is earlier than that in P. If this is not so, then
the Levitical legislation, conceived as given by Moses,
must be held to have proved impracticable, and Deuteronomy
must then be regarded as an abrogation of it for
the time.</p>

<p>And the same conclusions suggest themselves if we
look more closely into the curious fact that Deuteronomy
always speaks of the Levites as poor. Some have supposed
that this poverty is the result of the centralisation of the
cultus which the author demands, and that the constant
insistence that the Levite shall be invited to all sacrificial
feasts, along with the widow and the orphan, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
helpless classes, is a provision against the poverty to be
brought upon them by the abolition of the High Places.
But that is not so. We know the manner of the Deuteronomist
when he is providing for contingencies arising
from the new state of things he wishes to bring about,
and it is quite different from his manner here. Clearly,
the Levites were poor before the suppression of the High
Places, and were so, as Deuteronomy tells us, from the
fact that they had no inheritance in the land. But that
poverty is not consistent with their whole position as
sketched in the Levitical legislation. There we have
the Levites launched as a regularly organised priestly
corporation, endowed with ample revenues, and ruled
and represented by a high priest of the family of
Aaron, clothed with powers almost royal, surrounded by a
priestly nobility of his own family and by a bodyguard of
tribesmen entirely at his disposal. Such a body never
has remained chronically and notoriously poor. In the
wilderness they would not be so in contrast with others,
for all were poor, and there was nothing to hinder the
Levites having cattle as the other tribes had, and being
on the same level as they. In the promised land, instead
of becoming poor, they would at once enter upon the
enjoyment of their various tithes and dues, and would
moreover have such a share in the booty of Canaan as
would more than make up at first for their want of a
heritage. The priests were to receive one five-hundredth
part of the army's half, and the Levites the fiftieth share
of the people's half (Numb. xxxi. 28 ff.). Gradually, too,
they would be put in possession of the priestly cities.
Evidently, therefore, if the Levites were ever poor, it cannot
have been till some time after Israel had been settled in
the land, and then only if P's laws and organisations of
the tribe were not enforced.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy supports the same argument. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
want of a heritage was the cause of the Levites' poverty,
they cannot have been <em>exceptionally</em> poor in the wilderness.
Nor can they have been poor during the time
of the conquest; for even if the Levitical law was in
force and the tribe was then wholly organised for the
priesthood, they must have shared in the fighting and
the spoil. But if the order of legislation, as we maintain,
was (1) Exodus xx.-xxiii., (2) Deuteronomy, (3) the
Priest Codex, then as the booty from war ceased to
be a source of income, the Levites as a body remaining
nomads, while the other tribes became agricultural, would
necessarily become poor in comparison with their fellow-countrymen.
It is out of that state of things the Deuteronomist
speaks.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The same conclusions follow when the regulations are
examined which bear upon the support of the priestly
tribe. The outstanding matters in this department are
tithes and firstlings. Space will not admit of a full discussion
of these topics; but if the reader will compare, in
regard to tithes, Numb. xviii. 21-24 and Lev. xxvii. 30, 32,
with Deut. xii. 17, and in regard to firstlings Numb. xviii.
18 with Deut. xii. 6, 17 f., and xv. 19 f., he will see that
the application of tithes and of firstlings according to
Deuteronomy is quite different from that in the Levitical
legislation. The difference is such as will not comport
with the hypothesis of a single legislator and a consistent
legislation. Expedients with a view to solve the difficulty
have been suggested by Keil and others; but each of those
expedients is burdened with specific difficulties of its own.</p>

<p>The inevitable conclusion from all this would seem to
be that in the Deuteronomic as in the Levitical laws we
have not the legislation of Moses or of his age alone.
The roots of all the legislative codes are Mosaic, but in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
save perhaps the Book of the Covenant the trunk and
branches are of much later growth. The authors of them
are not careful to distinguish what came from Moses
himself from that which had been developed out of it
under the influence of the same inspiration. In both
D and P there were Mosaic elements, and in both there
are laws not given by him. To disentangle these completely
now is impossible, and it is probably best for
expository purposes to take the codes as giving what the
Mosaic legislation had become at the time of the writer.
What we have in Deuteronomy therefore cannot be better
described than in Driver's words (<i>Introduction</i>, p. 85), as
"the prophetic re-formulation and adaptation to new needs
of an older legislation." Its relations to the other codes
are as the same critic states (p. 71): "It is an <em>expansion</em>
of that in JE (Exod. xx.-xxiii.); it is, in several features,
<em>parallel</em> to that in Lev. xvii.-xxvi.; it contains <em>allusions</em>
to laws such as those codified in some parts of P, while
from those contained in other parts of P it differs widely."
And the state of things in which these various codes
originated is more and more coming to be conceived in
the manner stated by Dr. A. B. Davidson.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "It is
evident," he says, "that two streams of thought, both
issuing from a fountain as high up as the very origin of
the nation, ran side by side down the whole history of the
people, the prophetic and the priestly. In the one Jehovah
is a moral ruler, a righteous king and judge, who punishes
iniquity judicially or forgives sins freely of His mercy.
In the other He is a Person dwelling among His people
in a house, a Holy Being or Nature, sensitive to every
uncleanness in all that is near Him, and requiring its
removal by lustrations and atonement. Those cherishing
the latter circle of conceptions might be as zealous for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Lord of Hosts as the prophets. And the developments
of the national history would extend their conceptions and
lead to the amplification of practices embodying them, just
as they extended the conceptions of the prophets. A
growth of priestly ideas is quite as probable as a growth
of prophetic ideas. That the streams ran apart is no
evidence that they were not equally ancient and always
contemporaneous, for we see Jeremiah and Ezekiel both
flourishing in one age. At one point in the history the
prophetic stream was swelled by an inflow from the priestly,
as is seen in Deuteronomy, and from the Restoration
downwards both streams appear to coalesce."</p>

<p>The actual date of Deuteronomy still remains to be
settled. Already it has been brought down to post-Solomonic
days. How much later must it probably be
put? The book must have been written before the
eighteenth year of Josiah, 621 <small>B.C.</small>, for the Book of the
Law which was then found in the Temple was undoubtedly
not the whole Pentateuch, but approximately
Deut. i.-xxvi. But it can hardly have been produced
in Josiah's reign, because it would never have been
permitted to drop out of sight had it been known to
that pious king and the reforming high priest Hilkiah.
On the other hand, it can hardly have been written or
known before Hezekiah's reforms, for otherwise it would
have been made the basis of them, as it was made
the basis of Josiah's. Probably, therefore, we may date
it between Hezekiah and Josiah. Indeed we may with
great likelihood affirm, as Robertson Smith suggests, that
it was the need of guidance caused by Hezekiah's reforms
which suggested and called out this book.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>But, say some, if the body of the book is not Mosaic,
then this is nothing else but forgery, and no forged or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
even pseudonymous book can be inspired! Others again,
most gratuitously, suppose that Hilkiah found the book
only because he had forged it and put it where it was found.
But there is neither need nor room for such suppositions;
and our effort must be to conceive to ourselves the means
by which such a book could come into existence, and
be found as it was, without fraud on the part of any
one.</p>

<p>To modern, and especially Western notions, it seems
difficult to conceive any legitimate process by which a book
of comparatively modern date could be attributed, so far as
its main part is concerned, to Moses, and published as
Mosaic. But if we take into account the character of Deuteronomy
as only an extension and adaptation of the Book of
the Covenant set in a framework of affectionate exhortation,
and that all men then believed that the Book of the Covenant
was Mosaic, we can see better how such action might
be considered legitimate. Even on modern and Western
principles we can see that; but at that early time and in
the East, literary methods and literary ideas were so
different from ours that there may have been customs
which made the publication of a book in this way not
only natural but right. An example from modern India
will make this clear. Among the sacred books of the
Hindus one of the most famous is the <cite>Laws of Manu</cite>.
This is a collection of religious, moral, and ceremonial
laws much like the Book of Leviticus. It is generally
admitted that it was not the work of any one man, but of
a school of legal writers and lawgivers who lived at very
various times, each of whom, with a clear conscience and
as a matter of course, adapted the works of his predecessors
to the need of his own day. And this practice,
together with the belief in its legitimacy, survives to
this day. In his <cite>Early Law and Custom</cite> (p. 161)
Sir Henry Maine tells us that "A gentleman in a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
official position in India has a native friend who has
devoted his life to preparing a new Book of Manu. He
does not, however, expect or care that it should be put in
force by any agency so ignoble as a British-Indian Legislature,
deriving its powers from an Act of Parliament not
a century old. He waits till there arises a king in India
who will serve God and take the law from the new
'Manu' when he sits in his Court of Justice." There
is here no question of fraud. This Indian gentleman
considers that his book <em>is</em> the Book of Manu, and
would be amazed if any one should question its identity
because he had edited it; and he supposes that the king he
looks for, if he should come in his day, would accept and
act upon it as a Divine authority. So strangely different
are Eastern notions from those of the West. It is legitimate
to suppose that <em>this</em> Eastern book originated in
something of the same fashion. In the evil days of
persecution, when all the prophetic spokesmen were cut
off, and when the priests were occupying the chief
position among the supporters of pure religion, some
pious man, inspired, but not with the prophetic inspiration,
set himself, like this modern Hindu, to re-write and
adapt the legislation which he believed to be Mosaic to
the needs of his own day. Altering the fundamental
points as little as might be, he developed it to meet the
evils which were threatening the Mosaic religion; and he
inspired it with the passion for righteousness and the
love of God which had already thrilled the hearts of
faithful men in Israel through the ministry of the great
prophets. Hoping for the coming of a king who should
serve God and judge Israel out of this new Book of Moses,
but while the darkness still clouded the future, he died,
committing his book to some temple chamber where he
might hope that it would be discovered when God's set
time should come. In such a supposition there is perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
something to shock the conventional theories of our time.
But, so far as can be seen, there is nothing to shock
any open-minded man who knows how widely ancient
and Eastern thought differs from modern and Western
thought. It is certain that at this day Eastern men of
the highest character and of the most burning zeal for
religion would act in this manner without a qualm of
conscience. We may well believe, therefore, that in
ancient days it was the same. If so, this was a literary
method which inspiration might well use; and the supposition
that Deuteronomy was so produced is certainly
more consistent with its history and character than any
other. It explains how it so exactly met the needs of
the time and summed up all its aspirations; and it gives
to its claim of inspiration a new support by laying bare
the circumstances of its birth and its psychological presuppositions.</p>

<p>But it may still be asked, what are we to think of the
Mosaic speeches, which, as has been seen, contain, to
say the least, much non-Mosaic matter? The answer
probably is that in these, as in the laws, the author relies
upon earlier documents. From the appearance in the
codes of laws which would have little or no meaning if
originated in the time of the Deuteronomist, it has rightly
been concluded that there are very ancient and Mosaic
elements in them. So, in the speeches there are references
and allusions that suggest an ancient tradition of
a final address of Moses, and perhaps a written account
of its general purport, in which even a hope that the
worship might be centralised may have been contained.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
This the author has adapted to his purpose of inciting his
contemporaries to be faithful to the Mosaic teaching, and
has woven into it all that later experience could suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
as effective ground of exhortation. So much as that
all ancient historians would have done, and some moderns
would do, without the faintest intention to deceive, or
any feeling of guilt; and so much may probably have
been done here. Delitzsch,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Robertson Smith,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and
Driver<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> are all at one as to this, and in the proofs they
produce of the necessity of accepting this view. In the
words of Driver, "It is the uniform practice of the Biblical
historians in both the Old and New Testaments to represent
their characters as speaking in words and phrases
which cannot have been those actually used, but which
they themselves select and frame for them." The speeches
of David in Samuel and Chronicles serve for examples.
In Samuel he speaks in the language of Samuel, in
Chronicles in the language of Chronicles. "In some of
these cases," Driver continues, "the authors no doubt
had information as to what was actually said on the
occasions in question, which they recast in their own
words, only preserving, perhaps, a few characteristic
expressions; in other cases, they merely gave articulate
expression to the thoughts and feelings which it was
presumed that the persons in question would have entertained.
In the Deuteronomic speeches both these
characteristic methods have probably been employed, and
we must just accept the inspired record for what it reveals
itself to be, setting aside, with the inevitable sighs, our
own <i>√† priori</i> assumptions of what it ought to be."</p>

<p>These then are the conclusions regarding Deuteronomy
on which the exposition offered here will rest. They
have been reached after a careful consideration of the
evidence on both sides, and are stated here not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
without regret. For, as Robertson Smith has well said,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
"to the ordinary believer the Bible is precious as the
practical rule of faith and life in which God still speaks
directly to his heart. No criticism can be otherwise than
hurtful to faith if it shakes the confidence with which the
simple Christian turns to his Bible, assured that he can
receive every message which it brings to his soul as a
message from God Himself." Now, though it can be
demonstrated that the view of Scripture which permits
of such conclusions as those stated above is quite
compatible with this believing confidence, there can be
little doubt that Christian people will for a time find great
difficulty in accepting this assurance. The transition from
the old view of inspiration, so complete, comprehensible,
and effective as it is, to the newer and less definite
doctrine, cannot fail to be trying, and the introduction
of it here cannot but be a disturbing influence which it
would have been greatly preferable to avoid.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that to the minds
of the working ministry and of their earnest fellow-labourers,
who come into constant contact with the actual
needs of men, the change should be unwelcome. But it
cannot now, in my judgment, be avoided. Even the best
and most scholarly work of those who still hold the traditional
view does not convince. Rather it is their writings,
more even than those on the modern side, which make it
clear that the traditional view can no longer be held. These
writers admit the facts upon which their opponents' case
rests, and then explain them all away, harmonising everything
by a crowd of hypotheses, often scholarly, generally
acute, but almost always such as can be accepted only if we
know beforehand that the view they support is true. But
far too many hypotheses are needed. Each case has to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
set right by a special effort of the imagination; while the new
view has this great advantage, that it makes room for all
the facts, by a hypothesis, suggested not by one difficulty,
but by almost all the discrepancies and difficulties which are
encountered. And, after all, this view does not move men
away from the central truth of inspiration, even as it was
conceived by the last generation. Apart from any care
for averting errors in detail which can be ascribed to
Divine wisdom according to the old view or the new,
the central thing in both surely is the revelation of God
Himself. It was always God that was held to be
revealed, and this the advocates of the newer view
insist upon most strenuously. They hold that chosen
men, the wisest, best, most truthful of their respective
generations, those who travailed most in thought, received
exceptional impressions of the Divine nature. They
saw God, and their whole being bore the impress henceforth
of this illumination. In every word and act the
light they had received found expression for itself. They
did not receive this revelation in mere propositions
about God, which had to be carefully repeated with
minute verbal accuracy. They saw, and their natures
were in their degree uplifted, changed, and harmonised
with the Divine. They could no more be false in speaking
of what they had thus experienced, than a sincere
and tender nature can be false in speech or thought
about death, when it once has found its love frustrated
and overborne by that dread messenger of God. The
impression in both cases is true as it is final, and it will
triumphantly convey itself to others with substantial and
effective truth, whatever the man's knowledge or ignorance
otherwise may be. When a man has received an
impression, or a sight of God which has shaken his very
soul, will it be lost in its essential parts because in the
speech in which he utters it he shows ignorance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
science, or accepts as simply true the historic knowledge
of his day? The thing is impossible. The light that
is within him must shine out, even though the medium
through which it shines be here and there blackened
by imperfection. In the fundamental point, therefore,
the old school of critics and the new are entirely at
one. On the basis of this essential harmony it should
be possible for each to speak to the other for edification.
This is what has been attempted here; and if those who
hold by the Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy will
tolerate the opposite view, they will find that in dealing
with the Scriptures as a revelation of God, and as an
infallible guide in all that concerns religious and moral
truth, there is no difference. To make the sacred word
living and powerful as an instrument of spiritual regeneration
is our common effort; and our common hope must be
that, if in anything we have been led into error, the
mistake may be discovered and removed, before it has
wrought evil in the Church of God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><i>THE HISTORIC SETTING OF DEUTERONOMY</i></h3>


<p>Whatever may be the date of the first publication
of Deuteronomy, there can be no doubt that it
was accepted by Josiah and the people of his time with
an energy and thoroughness of which we find no previous
example. Its main lessons were learnt and put into
practice by them, and from that period the religious
conceptions of Deuteronomy dominated and formed the
Hebrew mind in a manner of which we have no earlier
trace. For practical purposes, therefore, we may say
that this was the Deuteronomic period. The book
gathered up and embodied the higher strivings of that
time; and to understand it thoroughly we need to know
the history of which it was, in part at least, the outcome.
Indeed, on any supposition as to age and authorship, a
study of the history of Judah from the end of the eighth
century <small>B.C.</small> to the end of the seventh is indispensable if
we would adequately understand our book, for that was
the time when the book is seen entering as a living force
into the history of Israel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, there are few periods of Israelite
history as to which we have less of reliable information.
During much of the period the main currents of the
national life ran contrary to all better influences, and in
such epochs the compilers of the Book of Kings took no
interest. For the most part they were content to "look
and pass," gathering up the results of such times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
declension in a few condemnatory words. It is only when
the nation is on the upward slope that they enter into
details. They wrote at a time when the purpose of God
in their national life was becoming clear, and the splendour
of it possessed them so that nothing else but the increase
of this purpose seemed worthy of any intenser contemplation.
Victories and defeats, successes and failures, and
last of all the tremendous catastrophe of the Exile, had
taught them this discernment; and they pressed forward
so eagerly to record the deeds and thoughts of those who
had learned the secret of Yahweh that they had eyes for
nothing else. Consequently the eighty years after the
fall of Samaria, which for our purpose would be so
extremely instructive, are passed over in all our sources,
almost without mention. But there are some facts and
events of which we can be entirely sure; and from these
it is possible to conceive in outline the way in which
things must have shaped themselves in these eventful
years.</p>

<p>Brought about as it had been by the appeal of Ahaz to
the king of Assyria for help against the continual aggressions
of Syria and Israel, the fall of Samaria must have
come to the king and people of Judah as a relief. Their
enemy had fallen, and they would henceforth be free from
the anxiety and harassment which Israel's enmity had
caused. But those must have been blind indeed with
whom this feeling was permanent. Very soon it must
have become apparent to all thoughtful men in Judah that,
if they had been freed from the worrying and exasperating
enmity of their kindred, their very success had brought
them into the presence of a much more serious foe. With
Assyria on their immediate frontier, settled in the lands
both of Damascus and Samaria, they must have felt themselves
exposed to chances and dangers they had never
hitherto had to face. Under the old conditions, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
during comparatively short periods when there was actual
war between the two kingdoms, Israel had stood between
Judah and any danger from the North. But now the
people of the Southern Kingdom were summoned from
"the safe glad rear to the dreadful van." Henceforth
no patriot could fail to be haunted by fear of that
ambitious and conquering Assyrian nation. The whole of
Hezekiah's reign was filled with more or less convulsive
efforts to maintain the independence of Judah. These
were giving but faint promise of success, when the great
deliverance of Jerusalem foretold by Isaiah gave the king a
breathing space, and raised the highest hopes in the minds
of his people. It seemed for a little quite possible that the
ancient independence of Israel might be restored. To
many it seemed that the Messianic times were at hand;
faith in Yahweh carried all before it. But Hezekiah died
not long after; and in the succeeding reigns of Manasseh
and Amon the whole temper and policy of Israel underwent
a most serious and reactionary change.</p>

<p>The causes of this are not far to seek. During the
greater part of Hezekiah's reign Isaiah had received only
moderate support. According to his own vision of his
future work, he was to preach without success; he was to
say, "Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye,
but perceive not"; and, so far as the mass of the people
were concerned, that prevision was justified. Only the
astounding success with which his opposition to the
Assyrians had been crowned had turned the tide of
popular opinion in his favour. It was probably, therefore,
only then that Hezekiah's reforms were instituted. They
had been too short a time in force at his death to have
sent out their roots into the national life. But that was
not all. One of the most characteristic points in all
prophecy was that the <em>time</em> when the full Messianic Kingdom
should appear was never clearly defined. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the Prophet nor his hearers knew when it would be. It
loomed always as a bright but vague background to the
deliverance which lay immediately before them; and in
almost every case neither speaker nor hearers had any
conception of the long and weary way which divided those
sunlit mountain peaks from the dark and threatening
pass which they were approaching. Now the literal
interpretation of Isaiah's prophecies with regard to the
deliverance from Assyria had inevitably led the mass
of the people to believe that the raising of the siege
of Jerusalem would mean the immediate destruction of
Assyria, and the advent of the Messianic day of peace
and glory for Israel. But the facts completely falsified
that expectation. Instead of being destroyed Assyria
only grew more powerful, and instead of the Messianic
time there was only the old position of vassalage to
Assyria. So men grew weary, and said then as they have
said so often since, "All things are as they have been
from the beginning, and where is the promise of His
coming?" The true-hearted said it with sadness; and
the false-hearted, saying it in mockery and unbelief,
fell back upon the old heathenish test, and said, "The
gods of Assyria are stronger than Yahweh, and we must
give them a place in our adoration." With the bulk of
the people this required no really great change in their
point of view. They had believed in Yahweh and agreed
to purify His worship, because He had proved Himself
stronger than Sennacherib and his gods; and now when,
in the long run, Assyria was triumphing, they must have
seemed to themselves only to be following the teachings
of experience in giving the host of heaven equal honour
with their own ancestral God. The reaction, therefore,
was more in the outward expression than in principle,
and we can easily understand how it was so swift and
so universal. Manasseh, Hezekiah's son, had probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
opposed his father's policy, as the heir-apparent has so
often opposed the policy of the reigning monarch; and if,
as many suppose, Hezekiah lived for sixteen years after
the destruction of Sennacherib's host, Manasseh came to
the throne just when men's minds were most weary with
hope deferred, and when the Assyrian success was about
to reach its highest point before its final fall.</p>

<p>Accordingly Manasseh would seem to have undone at
once all that his father and Isaiah had accomplished.
Nay, he went further in the introduction of idolatry than
any even of the idolatrous kings who had preceded him.
In the Book of Kings the charges made against him are
three:&mdash;1st, that he introduced the worship of the host
of heaven according to the Assyrian ritual; 2nd, that he
took part in the Moloch-worship; and 3rd, that he restored
the old semi-Canaanite worship which it had been Isaiah's
most strenuous effort to root out. And this policy, evil
as it was in the eyes of all who cared for the higher
destinies of Israel, had at once great and striking external
success. For it meant complete submission to Assyria,
a willing vassalage from which even the wish for independence
had disappeared. The heart of the old Israelite
independence had been faith in Yahweh and confidence in
Israel's calling as His people. Even so late as Isaiah's
day it had been faith in Yahweh which had kept Hezekiah
steady in his opposition to apparently overwhelming force.
But now Manasseh and the people who supported him
exalted the gods of Assyria as an even surer refuge than
Yahweh had been. Having made that admission, there
was nothing left for them but to humble themselves under
the mighty hand of the great king and his great gods.
And this Israel under Manasseh did most thoroughly.
As Stade has strikingly said, "The Temple of the one
God of Israel became a Pantheon." The feeble attempts
which Ahaz had made in the same direction were utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
swept out of men's memory by the completeness of
Manasseh's apostasy. With this degradation of the
religious faith there also came, naturally, an intellectual
degradation. Superstition, baser even than idolatry, seized
upon the minds of men, and illegitimate efforts to pry
into the future or to influence the destinies of men by
magic and incantations became part of the popular fashion
of the day. The old religion of Israel had sternly set
itself against all such debasing practices. Alone amid the
religions of the ancient world, it had relentlessly refused
the help of necromancy and magic generally. But the
barrier the religion of Yahweh had erected fell at once
when its purity and uniqueness had been sacrificed, and
Manasseh gave himself up to "practise augury and to use
enchantments, and to deal with them that had familiar
spirits and with wizards." And to superstition he also
added cruelty. Not content with his signal victory over
all the best impulses of the past, not content with the
applause of the multitude who gladly followed him to do
evil, he endeavoured to force those whose work he had
destroyed to bow before the gods they both hated and
despised. We know too little of the circumstances of the
time to be sure of his motives, but his action may have
been founded upon a craven fear that if he did not suppress
the voices of those who spoke for freedom, he might be
visited with the anger of the Assyrian king. Or it may
have been that feeling, so powerfully expressed in Browning's
poem "Instans Tyrannus," which makes a tyrant feel
that all his life is made bitter to him if there remain
within his power one free man whom he cannot bend to
his will. In any case it is certain that he attacked the
prophetic party with sanguinary fury. Though he had
the gods of the great battalions on his side, he was dimly
afraid of the power of ideas; and, so far as faithful men
were concerned, he instituted a "reign of terror." According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to the graphic statement of the historian, "he filled
Jerusalem with innocent blood from lip to lip," and for
the time at least was able to silence righteousness so far
as public utterance was concerned. There is a tradition
that even Isaiah fell a victim to his fury, being sawn
asunder between two planks at his command. It is
perhaps not likely that Isaiah had survived so long. But,
beyond all doubt, many suffered for their faithfulness to
God; and it seems probable that the wonderful picture of
the Suffering Servant in the Deutero-Isaiah owes much
of its colour to the pathetic and painful memories of this
evil time.</p>

<p>All this apostasy brought with it worldly success.
Manasseh reigned long, and under him the land had
peace. Assyria <em>could</em> have no quarrel with a people and
a king who anticipated its very desire by eager submission.
Peace brought material prosperity. The land was
so naturally fertile that it always grew rich when war was
kept from its borders. We may surmise, too, that a kind
of bastard culture became popular when the Jewish mind
had opened to it, for good and evil, a world of myth and
song and legend which, if known before, had until now
been barred from complete and triumphant entrance by
faith in a living God. Once only would Manasseh
appear to have asserted himself, and, according to the
Book of Chronicles, he was taken prisoner in Jerusalem
by the master he had served so well, and learned to know
in the bitterness of a Babylonian prison that sycophancy
does not always lead to safety. And the wisdom he
learned went further even than that. At the end of his
life he appears to have wished to undo, at least in some
measure, the evil he had laboured throughout his reign to
establish and make strong. But he found that to be
impossible; and if his repentance was deep and sincere he
must have learned how severely the heavenly powers can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
punish, by opening a man's eyes to the evil he has done
when it cannot be undone. Nor did his late repentance
affect his son, for under Amon all things continued in
their previous evil course. Indeed the prevailing idolatry
had rooted itself so firmly that even in the early years of
Josiah, when the prophetic influence was beginning to
reappear, it still retained its hold with unshaken power.</p>

<p>But what of the prophetic party during those evil days?
Precipitated from power in an instant at Hezekiah's
death, it had at once become feeble and obscure. Its
leading supporters, we may well believe, had to seek
safety in hiding or in flight; and after some of its chief
speakers had been cut off, the once dominant party had
to take the position of persecuted remnants for whom all
public work was impossible. Under such circumstances
what could these faithful men do? They could only
wait and pray, and prepare for that better day of whose
return their faith in Yahweh would not suffer them to
despair.</p>

<p>From the position afterwards taken up by the high
priest, it would seem probable that the Temple clergy
were in full sympathy with the prophetic movement. We
need not suppose that that sympathy arose wholly from
the tendency of prophetic thought and effort towards the
suppression of the High Places. We should probably do
the better spirits among the priesthood grievous wrong
if we thought that their personal interest was their main
motive in supporting even that reform. Notwithstanding
the earlier prophets' denunciation of the priests as a
class, there can be little doubt that they had advanced,
with the better classes of their nation generally, in their
appreciation of spiritual religion. And we may well
believe that the sight of the havoc which the now degraded
worship at the High Places was working in the popular
mind made them earnest in their endeavours to restore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the true faith. Privileged as they were, they would
naturally be sheltered from the full fury of the persecution.
Consequently, when the time came for the
supporters of true religion to take their place in public
life again, it was natural and inevitable that the priests
should be at their head. The fact, too, that Josiah at
his accession was a child, for whose guardian no fitter
person could be found than the chief priest, gave the
future into their hands. But they did not move prematurely.
So long as Josiah was a minor they contented
themselves with instilling their principles into the mind
of the king. In outward political life, so far as we can
ascertain, they did not interfere at all, and the ground was
moved away from beneath the feet of the idolatrous party,
while they thought themselves firmly established. In
Josiah's eighteenth year the results of this quiet preparation
appeared. In that year Hilkiah, the high priest, told
Shaphan the scribe that he had found "the Book of the
Law" in the Temple. That this was Deuteronomy, if
not altogether, yet practically, as we have it now, there
can be but little doubt; and it immediately became the
text-book of religion for all that remained of Israel.</p>

<p>Now it is obvious that the whole hopes of the religious
party would naturally be fixed upon it. They would
turn to it as eagerly as the Reformers turned to the Bible,
after it had been rediscovered by Luther at Erfurt.
For obviously, if the people could be got to acknowledge
the law, the axe would be laid at the root of every evil
which they deplored. The High Places would be destroyed;
the primacy of the Temple at Jerusalem would
be secured; and the prophetic teaching, with its insistence
upon judgment and the love of God as the essentials of
true worship, would, for the first time, become the
dominant influence in civil and religious life. Never since
Israel was a nation had the condition of the people called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
so loudly for the enforcement of such a law, and now for
the first time was there hope that it might be actually
enforced. The character of the evils that afflicted the
nation, the history of the last half-century, and the
teachings of the great canonical prophets had all converged,
as it were, to this one point, and we can understand
how all who strove for the higher life of Israel would
strive that Deuteronomy, whether ancient or modern,
should be neglected no longer. The result was that the
whole power of the State was thrown into the struggle
against idolatry and the half-heathen Bamoth-worship.
The prophets and the priests joined hands to spread the
principles of the true religion, as voiced by Deuteronomy.
Professor Cheyne, in his <cite>Jeremiah</cite>, conjectures, with
considerable likelihood, that the break in that prophet's
activity which occurred at this time is to be accounted for
by the zeal with which he devoted himself to Deuteronomic
propaganda throughout the land. In any case, for the
moment the purer worship obtained a completer victory
than ever before. Unfortunately it came too late and
proved too evanescent. But in the inward sphere, the
Deuteronomic view of religion as having its centre in love
to God, the tender, thoughtful evangelical spirit which
distinguishes the whole outlook of its author, laid hold
upon all the higher minds that came after it. To
Jeremiah and to St. Paul alike, it, <i>par excellence</i>, represented
the law of God. Produced, or at any rate first prized, at
a time when Israel had fallen very low, when evil was
triumphant and good persecuted, it recommended and
exemplified a cheerful courage, born of faith in the high
destiny of Israel and the truth of God. That, more than
anything else, helped to bear the ark of the Church over
the tumultuous centuries which separated those two great
servants of God, and when Christ appeared it was seen
that this book, more than any in the Old Testament save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
perhaps the Psalms, had anticipated His cardinal teachings
regarding the attitude of man to God and of man to man.
The conflicts and needs of the seventh century <small>B.C.</small>, which
are so clearly reflected in it, gave inspiration the opportunity
it needed to reveal that inner secret of God's
Kingdom. Out of defeat and disaster this revelation
came, and through times of defeat and backsliding it
proved its Divine origin by keeping steadfast and calm
those who specially waited for the coming of the Messiah.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><i>THE DIVINE GOVERNMENT</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> i.-iii.</h4>


<p>After these preliminary discussions we now enter
upon the exposition. With the exception of the
first two verses of chapter i., concerning which there
is a doubt whether they do not belong to Numbers,
these three chapters stand out as the first section of our
book. Examination shows that they form a separate and
distinct whole, not continued in chapter iv.; but there has
been a great diversity of opinion as to their authorship
and the intention with which they have been placed here.
The vocabulary and the style so resemble those of the
main parts of the book, that they cannot be entirely
separated from them; yet, at the same time, it seems
unlikely that the original author of the main trunk of
Deuteronomy can have begun his book with this introductory
speech from Moses, followed it up with another
Mosaic speech, still introductory, in chapter iv., and in
chapter v. begun yet another introductory speech running
through seven chapters, before he comes to the statutes
and judgments which are announced at the very beginning.
The current supposition about these chapters, therefore, is
that they are the work of a Deuteronomist, a man formed
under the influence of Deuteronomy and filled with its
spirit, but not the author of the book. This seems to
account for the resemblances, and would also explain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
some extent the existence of such a superfluous prologue.
But the hypothesis is, nevertheless, not entirely satisfactory.
The resemblances are closer than we should
expect in the work of different authors; and one feels that
the supposed Deuteronomist must have been less sensitive
in a literary sense than we have any right to suppose him
if he did not feel the incongruity of such a speech in this
place. Professor Dillmann has made a very acute suggestion,
which meets the whole difficulty in a more natural way.
Feeling that the style and language were in all essentials
one with those of the central Deuteronomy, he seeks for
some explanation which would permit him to assign this
section to the author of the book himself. He suggests
that as originally written this was a historical introduction
leading up to the central code of laws; a historical preface,
in fact, which the author of Deuteronomy naturally prefixed
to his book. <cite>Ex hypothesi</cite> he had not the previous
books, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, before him as we
have them. These now form a historical introduction to
Deuteronomy of a very minute and elaborate kind; but
he had to embody in his own book all of the past history
of his people that he wished to emphasise. But when the
editor who arranged the Pentateuch as we now have it
inserted Deuteronomy in its present place, he found that
he had a double historical preface, that in the previous
books and this in Deuteronomy itself. As reverence forbade
the rejection of these chapters, he took refuge in the
expedient of turning the originally impersonal narrative
into a speech of Moses; which he could all the more
blamelessly do as the probability is that the whole book
was regarded in his time as the work of Moses. This
hypothesis, if it can be accepted, certainly accounts for all
the phenomena presented by these chapters&mdash;the similarity
of language, the arch√¶ological notes in the speech, and
the historic colour in the statements regarding Edom, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
example, which corresponds to early feeling, not to post-exilic
thought at all. It has besides the merit of reducing
the number of anonymous writers to be taken account of
in the Pentateuch, a most desirable thing in itself. Lastly,
it gives us in Deuteronomy a compact whole more complete
in all its parts than almost any other portion of the Old
Testament, certainly more so than any of the books
containing legislation.</p>

<p>Moreover, that the Deuteronomic reinforcement and
expansion of the Mosaic legislation, as contained in the
Book of the Covenant, should begin with such a history of
Yahweh's dealings with His people, is entirely characteristic
of Old Testament Revelation. In the main and primarily,
what the Old Testament writers give us is a history of
how God wrought, how He dealt with the people He had
chosen. In the view of the Hebrew writers, God's first
and main revelation of Himself is always in conduct. He
showed Himself good and merciful and gentle to His
people, and then, having so shown Himself, He has an
acknowledged right to claim their obedience. As St. Paul
has so powerfully pointed out, the law was secondary, not
primary. Grace, the free love and choice of God, was
always the beginning of true relations with Him, and only
after that had been known and accepted does He look for
the true life which His law is to regulate. Naturally,
therefore, when the author of Deuteronomy is about to
press upon Israel the law in its expanded form, to call
them back from many aberrations, to summon them to a
reformation and new establishment of the whole framework
of their lives, he turns back to remind them of what
their past had been. Law, therefore, is only a secondary
deposit of Revelation. If we are true to the Biblical point
of view we shall not look for the Divine voice only, or even
chiefly, in the legal portions of the Scripture. God's full
revelation of Himself will be seen in the process and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
completion of that age-long movement, which was begun
when Israel first became a nation by receiving Yahweh
as their God, and which ended with the life and death
of Him who summed up in Himself all that Israel was
called, but failed, to be.</p>

<p>That is the ruling thought in Scripture about Revelation.
God reveals Himself in history; and by the
persistent thoroughness with which the Scriptural writers
grasp this thought, the unique and effective character of
the Biblical Revelation is largely accounted for. Other
nations, no doubt, looked back at times upon what their
gods had done for them, and those who spoke for these
gods may often have claimed obedience and service from
their people on the ground of past favour and under
threats of its withdrawal. But earlier than any other
people which has affected the higher races of mankind,
Israel conceived of God as a moral power with a will and
purpose which embraced mankind. Further, in the belief
which appears in their earliest records, that through them
the nations were to be blessed, and that in the future
One was coming who would in Himself bring about the
realisation of Israel's destiny, they were provided with a
philosophy of history, with a conception which was fitted
to draw into organic connection with itself all the various
fortunes of Israel and of the nations.</p>

<p>Of course, at first much that was involved in their
view was not present to any mind. It was the very
merit of the germinal revelation made through Moses
that it had in it powers of growth and expansion. In
no other way could it be a true revelation of God, a
revelation which should have in it the fulness, the flexibility,
the aloofness from mere local and temporary
peculiarities, which would secure its fitness for universal
mankind. Any revelation that consists only of words, of
ideas even, must, to be received, have some kind of relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to the minds that are to receive it. If the words and
ideas are revealed, as they must be, at a given place and
a given time, they must be in such a relation to that
place and time that at some period of the world's history
they will be found inadequate, needing expansion, which
does not come naturally, and then they have to be laid
aside as insufficient. But a revelation which consists in
acts, which reveals God in intimate, age-long, constant
dealings with mankind, is so many-sided, so varied, so
closely moulded to the actual and universal needs of man,
that it embraces all the fundamental exigencies of human
life, and must always continue to cover human experience.
From it men may draw off systems of doctrines, which
may concentrate the revelation for a particular generation,
or for a series of generations, and make it more potently
active in these circumstances. But unless the system be
kept constantly in touch with the revelation as given in
the history, it must become inadequate, false in part, and
must one day vanish away.</p>

<p>The revelation then in life is the only possible form
for a real revelation of God; and that the writers of
the Old Testament in their circumstances and in their
time felt and asserted this, is in itself so very great a
merit, that it is almost of itself sufficient to justify any
claims they may make to special inspiration. The greatest
of them saw God at work in the world, and had experience
of His influence in themselves, so that they had their
eyes opened to His actions as other men had not. The
least of them, again, had been placed at the true point of
view for estimating aright the significance of the ordinary
action of the Divine Providence, and for tracing the lines
of Divine action where they were to other men invisible,
or at least obscure. And in the records they have left us
they have been entirely true to that supremely important
point of view. All they deal with in the history is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
moral and spiritual effects of God's dealing; and the
great interests, as the world reckons them, of war and
conquest, of commerce and art, are referred to only briefly
and often only in the way of allusion. To many moderns
this is an offence, which they avenge by speaking contemptuously
of the mental endowment of the Biblical
writers as historians. On the contrary, that these should
have kept their eyes fixed only upon that which concerned
the religious life of their people, that they should have
kept firm hold of the truth that it was there the central
importance of the people lay, and that they have given us
the material for the formation of that great conception of
supernatural revelation by history in which God Himself
moves as a factor, is a merit so great that even if it were
only a brilliant fancy they might surely be pardoned for
ignoring other things. But if, as is the truth, they were
tracing the central stream of God's redemptive action in
the world, were laying open to our view the steps by
which the unapproachably lofty conception of God was
built up, which their nation alone has won for the human
race, then it can hardly seem a fault that nothing else
appealed to them. They have given God to those who
were blindly groping for Him, and they have established
the standard by which all historic estimates of even
modern life are ultimately to be measured.</p>

<p>For though there were in the history of that particular
nation, and in the line of preparation for Christ, special
miraculous manifestations of God's power and love, which
do not now occur, yet no judgment of the course of
history is worth anything, even to-day, which does not
occupy essentially the Biblical position. Ultimately the
thing to be considered is, what hath God wrought? If
that be ignored, then the stable and instructive element
in history has been kept out of sight, and the mind loses
itself hopelessly amid the weltering chaos of second causes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Froude, in his <cite>History of England</cite>, has noted this, and
declares that in the period he deals with it was the
religious men who alone had any true insight into the
tendency of things. They measured all things, almost
too crudely, by the Biblical standard; but so essentially
true and fundamental does that show itself to be, that
their judgment so formed has proved to be the only sound
one. This is what we should expect if God's power and
righteousness are the great factors in the drama which
the history of man and of the world unfolds to us. That
being so, the suicidal folly of the policy of any Church
or party which shuts the Bible away from popular use
is manifest. It is nothing short of a blinding of the
people's eyes, and a shutting of their ears to warning
voices which the providential government of the world,
when viewed on a large scale, never fails to utter. It
renders sound political judgment the prerogative only of
the few, and sets them among a people who will turn to
any charlatans rather than believe their voice.</p>

<p>It was natural and it was inevitable, therefore, that
the author of Deuteronomy, standing, as he did, on the
threshold of a great crisis in the history of Israel, should
turn the thoughts of his people back to the history of the
past. To him the great figure in the history of Israel
in those trying and eventful years during which they
wandered between Horeb, Kadesh-Barnea, and the country
of the Arnon, is Yahweh their God. He is behind all their
movements, impelling and inciting them to go on and
enjoy the good land He had promised to their fathers.
He went before them and fought for them. He bare
them in the wilderness, as a man doth bear his son. He
watched over them and guided their footsteps in cloud
and fire by day and night. Moreover all the nations by
whom they passed had been led by Him and assigned
their places, and only those nations whom Yahweh chose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had been given into Israel's hand. In the internal affairs
of the community, too, He had asserted Himself. They
were Yahweh's people, and all their national action was
to be according to His righteous character. Especially
was the administration of justice to be pure and impartial,
yielding to neither fear nor favour because the "judgment
is God's." And how had they responded to all this loving
favour on the part of God? At the first hint of serious
conflict they shrank back in fear. Notwithstanding that
the land which God had given them was a good and fruitful
country, and notwithstanding the promises of Divine
help, they refused to incur the necessary toils and risks
of the conquest. Every difficulty they might encounter
was exaggerated by them; their very deliverance from
Egypt, which they had been wont to consider "their
crowning mercy," became to their faithless cowardice an
evidence of hatred for them on the part of God.</p>

<p>To men in such a state of mind conquest was impossible;
and though, in a spasmodic revulsion from their abject
cowardice, they made an attack upon the people they
were to dispossess, it ended, as it could not but end, in
their defeat and rout. They were condemned to forty
years of wandering, and it was only after all that generation
was dead that Israel was again permitted to approach
the land of promise. But Yahweh had been faithful to
them, and when the time was come He opened the way
for their advance and gave them the victory and the land.
For His love was patient, and always made a way to bless
them, even through their sins.</p>

<p>That was the picture the Deuteronomist spread out
before the eyes of his countrymen, to the intent that they
might know the love of God, and might see that safety
lay for them in a willing yielding of themselves to that
love. The disastrous results of their wayward and
faint-hearted shrinking from this Divine calling is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
only direct threat he uses but in the passage there is
another warning, all the more impressive that it is vague
and shadowy. God is to the Deuteronomist the universal
ruler of the world. The nations are raised up and cast
down according to His will, and until He wills it they
cannot be dispossessed. But He had willed that fate for
many, and at every step of Israel's progress they come
upon traces of vanished peoples whom for their sins He
had suffered others to destroy. The Emim in Moab,
the Zamzummim in Ammon, the Horites in Seir, and the
Avvims in Philistia, had all been destroyed before the
people who now occupied these lands, and the whole
background of the narrative is one of judgment, where
mercy had been of no avail. The sword of the Lord is
dimly seen in the arch√¶ological notes which are so
frequent in this section of our book and thus the final
touch is given to the picture of the past which is here
drawn to be an impulse for the future. While all the
foreground represents only God's love and patience overcoming
man's rebellion, the background is, like the path
of the great pilgrim caravans which year by year make
their slow and toilsome way to Mohammedan holy places,
strewn with the remains of predecessors in the same path.
With stern, menacing finger this great teacher of Israel
points to these evidences that the Divine love and patience
may be, and have been, outworn, and seems to re-echo
in an even more impressive way the language of Isaiah:
"The anger of Yahweh was kindled (against these peoples),
and He stretched forth His hand (against them) and smote
(them); and the hills did tremble, and (their) carcases
were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this
His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched
out still." Without a word of direct rebuke he opens
his people's eyes to see that shadowy outstretched hand.
Behind all the turmoil of the world there is a presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and a power which supports all who seek good, but which
is sternly set against all evil, ready, when the moment
comes, "to strike once and strike no more."</p>

<p>Yet another glimpse is given us in these chapters of
God's manner of dealing with men. We have seen how
He guides and rules His chosen ones. We have seen
how He punishes those who have set themselves against
the Divine law. And in chapter ii. 30 we are told how
men become hardened in their sin, so as to render
destruction inevitable. Of Sihon, king of Heshbon, who
would not let the Israelites pass by him, the writer says:
"Yahweh thy God hardened his spirit, and made his
heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand,
as appeareth this day." But he does not mean by these
expressions to lay upon God the causation of Sihon's
obstinacy, so as to make the man a mere helpless victim.
His thought rather is, that as God rules all, so to Him
must be ultimately traced all that happens in the world.
In some sense all acts, whether good or bad, all agencies,
whether beneficent or destructive, have their source in
and their power from Him. But nevertheless men have
moral responsibility for their acts, and are fully and justly
conscious of ill desert. Consequently that hardening of
spirit or of heart, which at one moment may be attributed
solely to God, may at another be ascribed solely to the
evil determination of man. The most instructive instance
of this is to be found in the history of Pharaoh, when he
was commanded to let Israel go. In that narrative, from
Exodus iv. to xi., there is repeated interchange of expression.
Now it is Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart; now,
as in viii. 15 and 32, Pharaoh hardened his own heart;
and, again, Pharaoh's heart was hardened. In each case
the same thing is meant, and the varying expressions
correspond only to a difference of standpoint. When
Yahweh foretells that the signs He authorises Moses to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
show will fail of their effect, it is always "Yahweh will
harden Pharaoh's heart," since the main point in contemplation
is His government of the world. If, on the other
hand, it is the sinful obstinacy of Pharaoh which is
prominent in the passage, we have the self-determination
of Pharaoh alone set before us. But it is to be noted,
and this is indeed the cardinal fact, that Yahweh never
is said to harden the heart of a good man, or a man set
mainly upon righteousness. It is always those who are
guilty of palpable wrongs and acts of evil-doing upon
whom God thus works.</p>

<p>Now we know that the author of Deuteronomy had two
at least of the ancient historical narratives before him
which are combined in Exod. iv.-xi., and he takes up their
thinking. Expressed in modern language, the thought is
this. When men are found following their own will in
defiance of all law and all the restraints of righteousness,
that is manifestly not the first stage in their moral declension.
This obstinacy in evil is the result and the
wages of former evil deeds, beginning perhaps only with
careless laxity, but gathering strength and virulence with
every wilful sin. Until near the end of a completed growth
in wickedness no man deliberately says, "Evil, be thou
my good." Nevertheless each act of sin involves a step
towards that, and the sinner in this manner hardens
himself against all warning. Like the sins which work
this obduracy, this hardening is the sinner's own act.
The ruin which falls upon his moral nature is his own
work. That is the inexorable result of the moral order of
the universe, and from it no exception is possible. But
if so, God too has been active in all such catastrophes.
He has so framed and ordered the world that indulgence
in evil must harden in evil. This it was which the
Israelite religious mind saw and dwelt upon, as well as
upon man's share in the dread process of moral decay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
We also do well to take heed to this aspect of the truth.
When we do, we have solved the Scriptural difficulty
regarding the Divine hardening of man's heart. It is
simply the ancient formula for what every mind that is
ethically trained recognises in the world to-day. Those
who recognise themselves as children of God, and acknowledge
the obligations of His law, are dealt with in the
way of discipline with infinite love and patience. Those
who definitely set themselves against the moral order of
the world which God has established are broken in pieces
and destroyed. Between these two classes there are the
morally undetermined, who ultimately turn either to the
right hand or to the left. The process by which these
pass on to be numbered among the rebellious is pictured
in Scripture with extraordinary moral insight. The only
difference from a present-day description of it is, that here
God is kept constantly present to the mind as the chief
factor in the development of the soul. To-day, even those
who believe in God are apt to forget Him in tracing His
laws of action. But that is an error of the first magnitude.
It darkens the hope of man; for without a sure promise of
Divine help there is no certainty of moral victory either
for the race or the individual. It narrows our view of the
awful sweep of sin; for unless we see that sin affects even
the Ruler of the universe, and defies His unchanging law,
its results are limited to the evil that we do our fellow-men,
which, as we see it, is of little importance. Further,
it degrades moral law to a mere arbitrary dictum of
power, or to an opinion founded upon man's purblind
experience. The acknowledgment of God, on the
contrary, makes morality the very essence of the Divine
nature, and the unchangeable rule for the life of man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><i>THE DECALOGUE&mdash;ITS FORM</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> v. 1-21.</h4>


<p>As the fourth chapter belongs to the speech which
concludes the legislative portion of Deuteronomy
both in contents and language (see Chapter XXIII.), we
shall pass on now to the fifth chapter, which begins with
a recital of the Decalogue. As has already been pointed
out, the main trunk of the Book of Deuteronomy is a
repetition and expansion of the Law of the Covenant
contained in Exod. xx.-xxiii.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Now, both in Exodus
and Deuteronomy, before the more general and detailed
legislation, we have the Decalogue, or the Ten Words, as
it is called, in substantially the same form; and the
question immediately arises as to the age at which this
beautifully systematised and organised code of fundamental
laws came into existence. Whatever its origin, it is
an exceedingly remarkable document. It touches the
fundamental principles of religious and moral life with
so sure a hand that at this hour, for even the most
civilised nations, it sums up the moral code, and that so
effectively that no change or extension of it has ever been
proposed. That being its character, it becomes a question
of exceeding interest to decide whether it can justly be
referred to so early a time as the days of Moses. In
both the passages where it occurs it is represented as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
having been given to the people at Horeb by Yahweh
Himself, and it is made the earliest and most fundamental
part of the covenant between Him and Israel. It would
accordingly seem as if a claim were made for it as a
specially early and specially sacred law. Now, much as
critics have denied, there have been found very few who
deny that in the main some such law as this must have
been given to Israel in Moses' day. Even Kuenen admits
as much as that in his <cite>History of the Religion of Israel</cite>.
The only commandment of the ten he has difficulty in
accepting is the second, which forbids the making of any
graven image for worship. That, he thinks, cannot have
been in the original Decalogue, not because of any
peculiarity of language, or because of any incoherency
in composition, but simply because he cannot believe that
at that early day the religion of Yahweh could have been
so spiritual as to demand the prohibition of images. But
his reasons are extremely inadequate; more especially
as he admits that the Ark was the Mosaic Sanctuary, and
that in it there was no image, as there was none in the
Temple at Jerusalem. That Yahweh was worshipped
under the form of a calf at Horeb, and afterwards in
Northern Israel at Bethel and elsewhere, proves nothing.
A law does not forthwith extinguish that against which
it is directed, for idolatry continued even after Deuteronomy
was accepted as the law. Moreover, if, as Kuenen thinks,
calf-worship had existed in Israel before Moses, it was
not unnatural that it took centuries before the higher
view superseded the lower. Even by Christianity the
ancient superstitions and religious practices of heathenism
were not thoroughly overcome for centuries. Indeed in
many places they have not yet been entirely suppressed.
Nor does Wellhausen<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> make a better case for a late
Decalogue. His hesitation about it is most remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and the reasons he gives for tending to think it may be
late are singularly unsatisfactory. His first reason is
that "according to Exodus xxxiv. the commandments
which stood upon the two tables were quite different."
He relies on the words in ver. 28 of that chapter&mdash;"And
he (Moses) was there with the Lord forty days and forty
nights; he did neither eat bread nor drink water. And
he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the
ten words"&mdash;taking them to imply that the immediately
preceding commandments, which are of the same ritual
character with those which follow the Decalogue in
Exodus xx., are here called the ten words. But it is not
necessary to take the passage so. According to ver. 1
it was Yahweh who was to write the words on the tables,
and we cannot suppose that so flagrant a contradiction
should occur in a single chapter as that here it should
be said that Moses wrote the tables. Yahweh, who is
mentioned in the previous verse, must therefore be the
subject of <i>wayyikhtobh</i> (ver. 28), and the ten words consequently
are different from the words (up to ver. 27)
which Yahweh commanded Moses to write, somewhere,
but not on the tables. Besides, every one who attempts
to make ten words of the commands before ver. 27
brings out a different result, and that of itself, as Dillmann
says, is sufficient to show that the second Decalogue in
chapter xxxiv. is entirely fanciful. Wellhausen's second
reason is this: "The prohibition of images was quite
unknown during the other period: Moses himself is
said to have made a brazen serpent, which down to
Hezekiah's time continued to be worshipped as an image
of Jehovah." But the Decalogue does not prohibit the
making of every image; it prohibits the making of images
for worship. Therefore Moses might quite well have
made a figure of a serpent, even though he wrote the
Decalogue, if it was not meant for worship. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
is nothing said to lead us to believe that the serpent was
regarded as an image of Yahweh. Indeed the very
contrary is asserted; and if Israel in later times made a
bad use of this ancient relic of a great deliverance, Moses
can hardly be held responsible for that. In the third place,
Wellhausen says: "The essentially and necessarily national
character of the older phases of the religion of Yahweh
completely disappears in the quite universal code of morals
which is given in the Decalogue as the fundamental law
of Israel; but the entire series of religious personalities
throughout the period of the Judges and Kings&mdash;from
Deborah, who praised Jael's treacherous act of murder,
to David, who treated his prisoners of war with the utmost
cruelty&mdash;make it very difficult to believe that the religion
of Israel was from the outset one of a specifically moral
character." Surely this is very feeble criticism. On
the same grounds we might declare, because of the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or on account of Napoleon's
reported poisoning of his own wounded at Acre, that
Christianity was not a religion of a "specifically moral
character" at this present moment. Surely the facts that
people never live at the level of their ideals, and that the
lifting of a nation's life is a process which is as slow as
the raising of the level of the delta of the Nile, should be
too familiar to permit any one to be misled by difficulties
of this kind. Nor is his last ground in any degree more
convincing. "It is extremely doubtful," he says,
"whether the actual monotheism which is undoubtedly
presupposed in the universal moral precepts of the
Decalogue could have formed the foundation of a national
religion. It was first developed out of the national
religion at the downfall of the nation." The obvious
reply is that this is a <i>petitio principii</i>. The whole debate
in regard to this question is whether Moses was a
monotheist, or at least the founder of a religion which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
implicitly monotheistic from the beginning; and the date
of the Decalogue is interesting mainly because of the
light it would throw upon that question. To decide this
date therefore by the assertion that, being monotheistic,
the Decalogue cannot be Mosaic, is to assume the very
thing in dispute. Wellhausen himself, elsewhere (p. 434),
seems to favour the opposite view. In speaking of what
Moses did for Israel he says that through "the Torah,"
in the sense of decisions given by lot from the Ark, "he
gave a definite positive expression to their sense of
nationality and their idea of God. Yahweh was not
merely the God of Israel; as such He was the God at
once of Law and of Justice, the basis, the informing
principle, and the implied postulate of their national consciousness";
and again (p. 438), "As God of the nation
Yahweh became the God of Justice and of Right; as God
of Justice and Right, He came to be thought of as the
highest, and at last as the only power in heaven and
earth." In the Mosaic conception of God, therefore,
Wellhausen himself being witness, there lay implicitly,
perhaps even explicitly, the conception of Yahweh as
"the only power in heaven and earth." In that case,
is it reasonable to put the Decalogue late, because being
moral it is universal, and so implies monotheism?</p>

<p>But there is still other, and perhaps stronger evidence,
that the universality of the Decalogue is no indication
of a late date. On the contrary it would seem, from
Professor Muirhead's account of the Roman <i>fas</i>, that
universality in legal precept may be a mark of very
primitive laws. Speaking of Rome in its earliest stages
of growth, when the circumstances of the people in very
many respects resembled those of the Hebrews in Mosaic
times,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> he says: "We look in vain for, and it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
absurd to expect, any definite system of law in those early
times. What passed for it was a composite of <i>fas</i>, <i>jus</i>,
and <i>boni mores</i>, whose several limits and characteristics
it is extremely difficult to define." He then proceeds
to describe <i>fas</i>: "By <i>fas</i> was understood the will of
the gods, the laws given by Heaven for men on
earth, much of it regulative of ceremonial, but a by no
means insignificant part embodying rules of conduct.
It appears to have had a wider range than <i>jus</i>. There
were few of its commands, prohibitions, or precepts that
were addressed to men as citizens of any particular
state; <em>all mankind came within its scope</em>. It forbade that
a war should be undertaken without the prescribed fetial
ceremonial, and required that faith should be kept with
even an enemy&mdash;when a promise had been made to him
under sanction of an oath. It enjoined hospitality to
foreigners, because the stranger guest was presumed,
equally with his entertainer, to be an object of solicitude
to a higher power. It punished murder, for it was the
taking of a God-given life; the sale of a wife by her
husband, for she had become his partner in all things
human and Divine; the lifting of a hand against a parent,
for it was subversive of the first bond of society and
religion, the reverence due by a child to those to whom
he owed his existence; incestuous connections, for they
defiled the altar; the false oath, and the broken vow, for
they were an insult to the divinities invoked," etc. In fact,
the Roman <i>fas</i> had much the same character as the Decalogue
and the legislation of the first code (Exod. xx.-xxiii.).
Consequently those who have thought that all early
legislation must be concrete, narrow, particularistic,
bounded at widest by the direct needs of the men making
up the clan, tribe, or petty nationality, are wrong. The
early history of law shows that, along with that, there is
also a demand for some expression of the laws of life seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
from the point of view of man's relation to God. That
fact greatly strengthens the case for the early date of the
Decalogue. For practically it is the Hebrew <i>fas</i>. If it
has a higher tone and a wider sweep, if it provides a
framework into which human duty can, even now, without
undue stretching of it, be securely fitted, that is only what
we should expect, if God was working in the history and
development of this nation as nowhere else in the world.
In short, the history of primitive Roman law shows that,
without inspiration, a feeble wavering step would have
been taken to the development of a code of moral duty,
within the scope of which all mankind should come. With
inspiration, surely this effort would also be made, and
made with a success not elsewhere attained.</p>

<p>In none of the reasons which have been advanced,
therefore, is there anything to set against the Biblical
statement that the ten words were older and more sacred
than any other portion of the Israelite legislation, and that
they were Mosaic in origin. The universal hesitation
shown by the greater among the most advanced critics
in definitely removing the Decalogue from the foundations
of Israel's history, although its presence there is so great
an embarrassment to them, lets us see how strong the
case for the Mosaic origin is, and assures us that the
evidence is all in favour of this view.</p>

<p>But if it be Mosaic, at first sight the conclusion would
seem to be that the form of the Decalogue given in Exodus
is the more ancient, and that the text in Deuteronomy is
a later and somewhat extended version of that. Closer
examination, however, tends to suggest that the original
ten words, in their Mosaic form, differed from any of the
texts we have, and that of these the Exodus text in its
present form is later than that in Deuteronomy. The
great difference in length between the two halves of the
Decalogue suggests the probability that originally all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
commandments were short, and much the same in style
and character as the last half, "Thou shalt not steal,"
and so on. Further, when the reasons and inducements
given for the observance of the longer commands are set
aside, just such short commands are left to us as we find
in the second table. Lastly, differences between the versions
in Exodus and Deuteronomy occur in almost every
case in those parts of the text which may be regarded as
appendices. In fact there are only two variations in the
proper text of the commands. In the fourth, we have in
Exodus "Remember the Sabbath day," while in Deuteronomy
we have "Observe the Sabbath day"; but the
meaning is the same in both cases. In the tenth, in Exodus
the command is "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
house"; and the "house" is explained by the succeeding
clause, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor
his manservant," etc., to mean "household" in its widest
sense. In Deuteronomy the old meaning of "house" as
household and goods has fallen out of use, and the
component parts of the neighbour's household possessions
are named, beginning with his wife. Then follows the
"house" in its narrow meaning, as the mere dwelling,
grouped along with the slaves and cattle, and with
<i>tithawweh</i> substituted in Hebrew for <i>tachmodh</i>. Fundamentally
therefore the two recensions are the same.
Even in the reasons and explanations there is only one
really important variation. In Exod. xx. 11 the reason
for the observance of the fourth commandment is stated
thus: "For in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth,
the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and
hallowed it." In Deuteronomy, on the other hand, that
reason is omitted, and in its place we find this: "And thou
shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of
Egypt, and Yahweh thy God brought thee out thence by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm; therefore
Yahweh thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath."
Now if the reference to the creation had formed part of
the original text of the Decalogue in the days of the
author of Deuteronomy, if he had that before him as
actually spoken by Yahweh, it is difficult to believe that
he would have left it out and substituted another reason
in its stead. He would have no object in doing so, for he
could have added his own reason after that given in
Exodus, had he so desired. It is likely, therefore, that
in the original text no reason appeared; that Deuteronomy
first added a reason; while ver. 11 in Exod. xx.
was probably inserted there from a combination of
Exod. xxxi. 17 <i>b</i> and Gen. ii. 2 <i>b</i>,&mdash;"For in six days
Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day
He rested and was refreshed"; "and He rested on the
seventh day from all His work which He had made."
Both these texts belong to P and differ in style altogether
from JE, with whose language all the rest of the setting
of the Decalogue corresponds. On these suppositions
Exod. xx. 11 would necessarily be the latest part of the
two texts. Originally, therefore, the Mosaic commands
probably ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am Yahweh thy God, which brought thee out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p>

<p>"I. Thou shalt not have any other gods before Me.</p>

<p>"II. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.</p>

<p>"III. Thou shalt not take the name of Yahweh thy God
in vain.</p>

<p>"IV. Remember (<em>or</em> Keep) the day of rest to sanctify
it.</p>

<p>"V. Honour thy father and thy mother.</p>

<p>"VI. Thou shalt not kill.</p>

<p>"VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>

<p>"VIII. Thou shalt not steal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbour.</p>

<p>"X. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house."</p></blockquote>

<p>In that shape they contain everything that is fundamentally
important, and exhibit the foundations of the
Mosaic religion and polity in an entirely satisfactory and
credible form.</p>

<p>But, before passing on to consider the substance of the
Decalogue, it will be worth our while to consider what
the full significance of these differing recensions of the
Decalogue is. In both places the words are quoted
directly as having been spoken by Yahweh to the people,
and they are introduced by the quoting word "saying."
Now if we do not wish to square what we read with any
theory, the slight divergences between the two recensions
need not trouble us, for we have the substance of what
was said, and in the main the very words, and that is
really all we need to be assured of. But if, on the
contrary, we are going to insist that, this being part of
an inspired book, every word must be pressed with the
accuracy of a masoretic scribe, then we are brought into
inextricable difficulties. It cannot be true that at Horeb
Yahweh said two different things on this special occasion.
One or both of these accounts must be inaccurate, in the
pedantic sense of accuracy, and yet both have the same
claim to be inspired. In fact both <em>are</em> inspired; it is the
theory of inspiration which demands for revelation this
kind of accuracy that must go to the wall.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this instance is very instructive as
to the method of the ancient Hebrews in dealing with
legislation which was firmly held to be Mosaic, or even
directly Divine. If we are right in holding that originally
the ten words were, as we have supposed, limited to
definite short commands, this example teaches us that
where there could be no question of deceit, or even an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
object for deceiving, additions calculated to meet the needs
and defects of the particular period at which the laws are
written down, are inserted without any hint that they did
not form part of the original document. If this has been
done, even to the extent we have seen reason to infer,
in a small, carefully ordered, and specially ancient and
sacred code, how much more freely may we expect the
same thing to have been done in the looser and more
fluid regulations of the large political and ceremonial
codes, which on any supposition were posterior, and
much less fundamental and sacred. That there is for
<em>us</em> something disappointing, and even slightly questionable,
in such action is really nothing to the purpose.
We have to learn from the actual facts of revelation
how revelation may be, or perhaps even must be,
conveyed; and we cannot too soon learn the lesson
that to a singular degree, and in many other directions
than their notions of accuracy, the ancient mind differs
from the modern mind, and that at any period there is a
great gulf to be crossed before a Western mind can get
into any intimate and sure <em>rapport</em> with an Eastern mind.</p>

<p>One other thing is noteworthy. Wellhausen has
already been quoted as to the quite universal and moral
character of the Decalogue; and his view, that a code so
free from merely local and ceremonial provisions can
hardly be Mosaic, has been discussed. But, while rejecting
his conclusion, we must adhere to his premisses. By
emphasising the universal nature of the ten commandments,
and by showing that they preceded the ceremonial
law by many centuries, the critical school have cut away
the ground from under the semi-antinomian views once so
prevalent, and always so popular, with those who call
themselves advanced thinkers. It is now no longer
possible to maintain that the Decalogue was part of a
purely Jewish law, binding only upon Jews and passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
away at the advent of Christianity as the ceremonial law
did. Of course this view was never really taken seriously
in reference to murder or theft; but it has always been a
strong point with those who have wished to secularise the
Sunday. Now if the advanced critical position be in any
degree true, then the ten commandments stand quite
separate from the ceremonial law, have nothing in
common with it, and are handed down to us in a document
written before the conception even of a binding
ceremonial law had dawned upon the mind of any man in
Israel. Nor is there anything ceremonial or Jewish in the
command, Remember <em>or</em> Observe the rest-day to keep it
holy. In the reasons given in Exodus and Deuteronomy
we have the two principles which make this a moral and
universal command&mdash;the necessity for rest, and the
necessity of an opportunity to cultivate the spiritual
nature. Nothing indeed is said about worship; but it lies
in the nature of the case that if secular work was rigorously
forbidden, mere slothful abstinence from activity
cannot have been all that was meant. Worship, and
instruction in the things of the higher life, must certainly
have been practised in such a nation as Israel on such a
day; and we may therefore say that they were intended by
this commandment. Understood in that way, the fourth
commandment shows a delicate perception of the conditions
of the higher life, which surpasses even the
prohibition of covetousness in the tenth. In the words of
a working man who was advocating its observance, "It
gives God a chance"; that is, it gives man the leisure to
attend to God. But the moral point of view which it
implies is so high, and so difficult of attainment, that it is
only now that the nations of Europe are awaking to the
inestimable moral benefits of the Sabbath they have
despised. Because of this difficulty too, many who think
themselves to be leaders in the path of improvement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
are esteemed by others to be so, are never weary of trying
to weaken the moral consciousness of the people, until they
can steal this benefit away, on the ground that Sabbath-keeping
is a mere ceremonial observance. So far from
being that, it is a moral duty of the highest type; and
the danger in which it seems at times to stand is due
mainly to the fact that to appreciate it needs a far more
trained and sincere conscience than most of us can bring
to the consideration of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><i>THE DECALOGUE&mdash;ITS SUBSTANCE</i></h3>


<p>That the Decalogue in any of its forms must have
been the work of one mind, and that a very great
and powerful mind, will be evident on the most cursory
inspection. We have not here, as we have in other parts
of Scripture, fragments of legislation supplementary to a
large body of customary law, fragments which, because of
their intrinsic importance or the necessities of a particular
time, have been written down. We have here an extraordinarily
successful attempt to bring within a definite
small compass the fundamental laws of social and individual
life. The wonder of it does not lie in the individual
precepts. All of them, or almost all of them, can be
paralleled in the legislation of other peoples, as indeed
could not fail to be the case if the <em>fundamental</em> laws of
society and of individual conduct were aimed at. These
must be obeyed, more or less, in every society that
survives. It is the wisdom with which the selection has
been made; it is the sureness of hand which has picked
out just those things which were central, and has laid
aside as irrelevant everything local, temporary, and purely
ceremonial; it is the relation in which the whole is placed
to God,&mdash;these give this small code its distinction. In
these respects it is like the Lord's Prayer. It is vain
for men to point out this petition of that unique prayer as
occurring here, that other as occurring there, and a third
as found in yet another place. Even if every single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
petition contained in it could be unearthed somewhere, it
would still remain as unique as ever; for where can you
find a prayer which, like it, groups the fundamental
cries of humanity to God in such short space and with
so sure a touch, and brings them all into such deep connection
with the Fatherhood of God? In both cases, in
the prayer and in the Decalogue alike, we must recognise
that the grouping is the work of one mind; and in both
we must recognise also that, whatever were the natural
and human powers of the mind that wrought the code
and prayer respectively, the main element in the success
that has attended their work is the extraordinary degree
in which they were illumined by the Divine Spirit. But
where, between the time of Moses and the time when
Deuteronomy first laid hold upon the life of the nation,
are we to look for a legislator of this pre-eminence? So
far as we know the history, there is no name that would
occur to us. So far as can be seen, Moses alone has
been marked out for us in the history of his people as
equal to, and likely to undertake, such a task. Everything,
therefore, concurs to the conclusion that in the
Decalogue we have the first, the most sacred, and the
fundamental law in Israel. Here Moses spoke for God;
and whatever additions to his original ten words later times
may have made, they have not obscured or overlaid what
must be ascribed to him. He may not have been the
author of much that bears his name, for unquestionably
there were developments later than his time which were
called Mosaic because they were a continuation and
adaptation of his work; but we are justified in believing
that here we have the first law he gave to Israel; and in
it we should be able to see the really germinal principles
of the religion he taught.</p>

<p>Now, manifestly, a religion which spoke its first word
in the ten commandments, even in their simplest form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
must have been in its very heart and core moral. It
must always have been a heresy therefore, a denial of
the fundamental Mosaic conception, to place ritual observance
<i>per se</i> above moral and religious conduct, as a
means of approach to Yahweh. On any reading of the
commandments only the third and fourth (two out of
ten) refer to matters of mere worship; and even these
may more correctly be taken to refer primarily to the
moral aspects of the cultus. All the rest deal with
fundamental relations to God and man. Consequently
the prophets who, after the manner of Amos and Hosea,
denounce the prevailing belief that Yahweh's help could be
secured for Israel, whatever its moral state, by offerings
and sacrifices, were not teaching a new doctrine, first
discovered by themselves. They were simply reasserting
the fundamental principles of the Mosaic religion.
Reverence and righteousness&mdash;these from the first were
the twin pillars upon which it rested. Before ever the
ceremonial law, even in its most rudimentary form, had
been given, these were emphasised in the strongest way
as the requirements of Yahweh; and the people whom
the prophets reproved, instead of being the representatives
of the ancient Yahwistic faith, had rejected it.
Whether the popular view was a falling away from a
truer view which had once been popular, or whether
it represented a heathen tendency which remained in
Israel from pre-Mosaic times and had not even in the
days of Amos been overcome, it seems undeniable that it
was entirely contrary to the fundamental principles of
Yahwism as given by Moses. Even by the latest narrators,
those who brought our Pentateuch into its present
shape, and who were, it is supposed, completely under
the influence of ceremonial Judaism, the primarily moral
character of Yahweh's religion was acknowledged by the
place they gave to the ten commandments. They alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
are handed down as spoken by Yahweh Himself, and as
having preceded all other commands; and the terrors of
Sinai, the thunder and the earthquake, are made more
intimately the accompaniments of this law than of any
other. Unquestionably the mind of Israel always was,
that here, and not in the ceremonial law, was the centre
of gravity of Yahwism. In the view of that fact it is
somewhat hard to understand how so many writers of our
times, who admit the Decalogue to have been Mosaic, or
at any rate pre-prophetic, yet deny the prevailingly moral
character of the early religion of Israel. When this law
was once promulgated, the old naturalism in which Israel,
like other ancient races, had been entangled was repudiated,
and the relation between Yahweh and His
people was declared to be one which rested upon moral
conduct in the widest sense of that term. And the
ground of this fact is plainly declared here to be the
character of Yahweh: "I am the Lord thy God, that
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
of bondage." He was their deliverer, He had a right to
command them, and His commands revealed His nature
to His people.</p>

<p>The first four commandments show that Yahweh was
already conceived as a spiritual being, removed by a
whole heaven from the gods of the Canaanite nations by
whom Israel was surrounded. These were mere representatives
of the powers of nature. As such they were
regarded as existing in pairs, each god having his female
counterpart; and their acts had all the indifference to
moral considerations which nature in its processes shows.
They dwelt in mountain tops, in trees, in rude stones, or
in obelisks, and they were worshipped by rites so
sanguinary and licentious that Canaanite worship bore
everywhere a darker stain than even nature-worship elsewhere
had disclosed. In contrast to all this the Yahweh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the Decalogue is "alone," in solitary and unapproachable
separation. Amid all the unbridled speculation that
has been let loose on this subject, no one, I think, has
ever ventured to join with Him any name of a goddess,
and He sternly repudiates the worship of any other god
besides Him. Now, though there is nothing said of
monotheism here, <i>i.e.</i> of the doctrine that no god but
one exists, yet, in contrast to the hospitality which distinguished
and distinguishes nature-worship in all its
forms, Yahweh here claims from His people worship of
the most exclusive kind. Besides Him they were to have
no object of worship. He, in His unapproachable
separateness, had alone a claim upon their reverence.
Further, in contrast to the gods who dwelt in trees and
stones and pillars, and who could be represented by
symbols of that kind, Yahweh sternly forbade the making
of any image to represent Him. Thereby He declared
Himself spiritual, in so far as He claimed that no visible
thing could adequately represent Him. In contrast to the
ethnic religions in general, even that of Zarathushtra, the
noblest of all, where only the natural element of fire was
taken to be the god or his symbol, this fundamental
command asserts the supersensuous nature of the Deity,
thereby rising at one step clear above all naturalism.</p>

<p>So great is the step indeed, that Kuenen and others,
who cannot escape the evidence for the antiquity of the
other commandments, insist that this at least cannot be
pre-prophetic, since we have such numerous proofs of the
worship of Yahweh by images, down at least to the time
of Josiah's reform. But, by all but Stade, it is admitted
that there was at Shiloh under Eli, and at Jerusalem
under David and Solomon, no visible representation of
Deity. Now the same writers who tell us this everywhere
represent the worship of Yahweh by images as existing
among the people. According to their view, the nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
had a continual and hereditary tendency to slip into image-worship,
or to maintain it as pre-Mosaic custom. And
it is quite certain that up even to the Captivity, and after,
when, according to even the very boldest negative view,
this command had been long known, image-worship, not
only of Yahweh, but also of false gods and of the host of
heaven, was largely prevalent. Only the Captivity, with
its hardships and trials, brought Israel to see that image-worship
was incompatible with any true belief in Yahweh.
Undeniably, therefore, the existence of an authoritative
prohibition does not necessarily produce obedience; and
the Biblical view that the Decalogue is Israel's earliest law
proves to be the more reasonable, as well as the better
authenticated of the two. If, after the command beyond
all doubt existed in Israel, it needed the calamities of
Israel's last days, and the hardships and griefs of the
Exile, to get it completely observed, and if in Jerusalem
and at Shiloh in the pre-prophetic time Yahweh was
worshipped without images, there can hardly be a doubt
that this command must have existed in the earliest period.
For no religion is to be judged by the actual practice of
the multitude. The true criterion is its highest point;
and the imageless worship of Jerusalem is much more
difficult to understand if the second commandment was
not acknowledged previously in Israel, than it would be if
the Decalogue, essentially as we now have it, was acknowledged
in the days before the kingship at least.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The arguments advanced by Kuenen and Wellhausen
for a contrary view, beyond those we have just been considering,
rest on an undue extension of the prohibition to
make any likeness of anything. They adduce the brazen
serpent of Moses, and the Cherubim, and the brazen bulls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that bore the brazen laver in the court of the Temple at
Jerusalem, and the ornaments of that building, as a proof
that even in Jerusalem this commandment cannot have
been known. But, as we have seen, the original command
prohibited only the making of a <em>pesel</em>, <i>i.e.</i> of an image for
worship. The making of likenesses of men and animals
for mere purposes of art and adornment was never included;
and the whole objection falls to the ground unless
it be asserted that the bulls under the basin were actually
worshipped by those who came into the Temple!</p>

<p>The supersensuous nature of Yahweh must, therefore,
be taken to be a fundamental part of the Mosaic religion.
But besides being solitary and supersensuous, Yahweh was
declared by Moses, perhaps by His very name, to be not
only mighty, but helpful. The preface to the whole series
of commandments is, "I am Yahweh thy God, who brought
thee forth out of the land of Egypt." Now of all the
derivations of Yahweh, that which most nearly commands
universal acceptance is its derivation from <i>hayah</i>, to be.
And the probabilities are all in favour of the view that it
does not imply mere timeless existence, as the translation of
the explanation in Exodus<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> has led many to believe. That
is a purely philosophical idea entirely outside of morality,
and it can hardly be that the introduction to this moral
code, which announces the author of it, should contain no
moral reference. If the name be from Qal, and be connected
with <i>ehyeh</i>, then it means, as Dillmann says (<cite>Exodus and
Leviticus</cite>, p. 35), that He will be what He has been, and
the name involves a reference to all that the God of Israel
has been in the past. Such He will be in the future,
for He is what He is, without variableness or shadow of
turning. If, on the other hand, it be from Hiphil, it will
mean "He who causes to be," the creator. In either case
there is a clear rise above the ordinary Semitic names for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
God, Baal, Molech, Milkom, which all express mere lordship.
No doubt Yahweh was also called Baal, or Lord,
just as we find Him in the Psalms addressed as "my
King and my God"; but the specially Mosaic name, the
personal name of the God of Israel, does undoubtedly
imply quite another quality in God. It is the Helper who
has revealed Himself to Israel who here speaks. Hence
the addition, "who brought thee out of the land of
Egypt." It is as a Saviour that Yahweh addresses His
people. By His very name He lifts all the commands
He gives out of the region of mere might, or the still
lower region of gratification at offerings and precious
things bestowed, into the region of gratitude and love.</p>

<p>Further, by issuing this code under the name of Yahweh
Moses claimed for Him a moral character. Whether the
Hebrew word for holy, <i>qƒÅdh≈çsh</i>, implied more in those
days than mere separateness, may be doubted; but it is
impossible that the idea which we now connect with the
word "holy" should not have been held to be congruous
to, and expressive of, the nature of Yahweh. Here morality
in its initial and fundamental stages is set forth as an
expression of His will. And similarly, righteousness
must also be an attribute of His, for justice between man
and man is made to be His demand upon men. He Himself,
therefore, must be faithful as well as holy, and His
emancipation from the clinging chain of mere naturalism
was thereby completed. The Yahweh of the Decalogue
is therefore absolutely alone. He is supersensuous. He
is the Helper and Saviour, and He is holy and true.
These are His fundamental qualities. Such qualities may
be supposed to be present only in their elements, even
to the mind of Moses himself: yet the fundamental
germinal point was there: and all that has grown out of
it may be justly put to the credit of this first revelation.</p>

<p>A moment's thought will show how the teaching that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Yahweh alone was to be worshipped broke away from
the main stream of Semitic belief, and prepared the way
for the ultimate prevalence of the belief that God was one.
That He was supersensuous, so that He could not rightly
or adequately be represented by any likeness of anything
in heaven or earth or sea, left no possible outlet for
thought about Him, save in the direction that He was a
Spirit. In essence consequently the spirituality of God
was thereby secured. Still more important perhaps was
the conception of Yahweh as the Helper and Deliverer,
the Saviour of His people; for this at once suggested
the thought that the true bond between God and man
was not mere necessity, nor mere dependence upon resistless
power, but love&mdash;love to a Divine Helper who revealed
Himself in gracious acts and providences, and who longed
after and cared for His people with a perfectly undeserved
affection. Lastly, His holiness and faithfulness, His righteousness
in fact, held implicit in it His supremacy and
universality. As Wellhausen has said, "As God of
justice and right, Yahweh came to be thought of as the
highest, and at last as the only power in heaven and
earth." Whether that last stage was present to the mind
of Moses, or of any who received the commandments in
the first place, is of merely secondary importance. At
the very least, the way which must necessarily lead to
that stage was opened here, and the mind of man entered
upon the path to a pure monotheism, a monotheism
which separated God from the world, and referred to
His will all that happened in the world of created things.
God is One, God is a Spirit, God is Love, and God
rules over all&mdash;these are the attributes of Yahweh as
the Decalogue sets them forth; and in principle the
whole higher life of humanity was secured by the great
synthesis.</p>

<p>Like all beginnings, this was an achievement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
highest kind. Nowhere but in the soul of one Divinely
enlightened man could such a revelation have made itself
known; and the solitude of a lonely shepherd's life, following
upon the stir and training of a high place in the
cultured society of Egypt, gave precisely the kind of
environment which would prepare the soul to hear the
voice by which God spoke. For we are not to suppose
that this revelation came to Moses without any effort or
preparation on his part. God does not reveal His highest
to the slothful or the debased. Even when He speaks
from Sinai in thunder and in flame, it is only the man
who has been exercising himself in these great matters
who can understand and remember. All the people had
been terrified by the Divine Presence, but they forgot
the law immediately and fell back into idolatry. It was
Moses who retained it and brought it back to them again.
His personality was the organ of the Divine will; and in
this law which he promulgated Moses laid the foundation
of all that now forms the most cherished heritage of men.
The central thing in religion is the character of God.
Contrary to the prevailing feeling, which makes many say
that they know nothing of God, but are sure of their duty
to man, history teaches that, in the end, man's thought of
God is the decisive thing. Everything else shapes itself
according to that; and by taking the first great steps,
which broke through the limits of mere naturalism, Moses
laid the foundation of all that was to come. There was
here the promise and the potency of all higher life: love
and holiness had their way prepared, so that they should
one day become supreme in man's conception of the
highest life: the confused halting between the material
and the spiritual, which can be traced in the very highest
conceptions of merely natural religions, was in principle
done away. And what was here gained was never lost
again. Even though the multitude never really grasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
all that Moses had proclaimed Yahweh to be; and though
it should be proved, which is as yet by no means the
case, that even David thought of Him as limited in power
and claims by the extent of the land which Israel inhabited;
and though, as a matter of fact, the full-orbed universality
which the ten commandments implicitly held in them was
not attained under the old covenant at all; yet these ten
words remained always an incitement to higher thoughts.
No advance made in religion or morals by the chosen
people ever superseded them. Even when Christ came,
He came not to destroy but to fulfil. The highest reach
of even His thoughts as regards God could be brought
easily and naturally under the terms of this fundamental
revelation to Israel.</p>

<p>The remaining commands, those which deal with the
relations of men to each other, are naturally introduced
by the fifth commandment, which, while it deals with
human relations, deals with those which most nearly
resemble the relations between God and man. Reverence
for God, the deliverer and forgiver of men, is the sum of
the commandments which precede; and here we have
inculcated reverence for those who are, under God, the
source of life, upon whose love and care all, at their
entrance into life, are so absolutely dependent. Love is
not commanded; because in such relations it is natural,
and moreover it cannot be produced at will. But reverence
is; and from the place of the command, manifestly what
is required is something of that same awful respect which
is due to Yahweh Himself. The power which parents
had over their children in Israel was extensive, though
much less so than that possessed, for example, by Roman
parents. A father could sell his daughters to be espoused
as subordinate wives;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> he could disallow any vows a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
daughter might wish to take upon her;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and both parents
could bring an incorrigibly rebellious son to the elders of
the city<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and have him stoned publicly to death. But,
according to Moses, the main restraining forces in the
home should be love and reverence, guarded only by the
solemn sanction of death to the openly irreverent, just as
reverence for Yahweh was guarded.</p>

<p>There was here nothing of the sordid view, repudiated
so energetically by Jewish scholars like Kalisch,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that we
ought "to weigh and measure filial affection after the degree
of enjoyed benefits." No; to this law "the relation
between parents and children is holy, religious, godly,
not of a purely human character"; and it is a mere profanation
to regard it as we in modern times too often do.
In our mad pursuit after complete individual liberty we
have fallen back into a moral region which it was the
almost universal merit of the ancient civilisations to have
left behind them. It is true, certainly, that there were
reasons for this advance then which we could not now
recognise without falling back from our own attainments
in other directions; but it was the saving salt of the
ancient civilisations that the parents in a household were
surrounded with an atmosphere of reverence, which made
transgressions against them as rare as they were considered
horrible. The modern freedom may in favourable
circumstances produce more intimate and sympathetic
intercourse between parents and children; but in the
average household it has lowered the whole tone of family
life; and it threatens sooner or later, if the ancient feeling
cannot be restored, to destroy the family, the very keystone
of our religion and civilisation. This commandment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is not conditioned on the question whether parents have
been more or less successful in giving their children what
they desire, or whether they have been wise and unselfish
in their dealing with their children. As parents they have
a claim upon their respect, their tenderness, their observance,
which can be neglected only at the children's peril.
Even the average parent gives quite endless thought and
care to his children, and almost unconsciously falls into
the habit of living for them. That brings with it for the
children an indelible obligation; and along with the new
and wiser freedom which is permitted in the modern
home, this reverence should grow, just as the love and
reverence for God on the part of those who have been
made the free children of God through Christ ought far
to exceed that to which the best of the Old Testament
saints could attain.</p>

<p>Want of reverence for parents is, in the Decalogue,
made almost one with want of reverence toward God, and,
in the case of this human duty alone, there is a promise
annexed to its observance. The duty runs so deep into
the very core of human life, that its fulfilment brings wholesomeness
to the moral nature; this health spreads into the
merely physical constitution, and long life becomes the
reward. But apart from the quietude of heart and the
power of self-restraint which so great a duty rightly
fulfilled brings with it, we must also suppose that in a
special manner the blessing of God does rest upon dutiful
children. Even in the modern world, amid all its complexity,
and though in numberless instances it may seem
to have been falsified, this promise verifies itself on the
large scale. In the less complex life of early Israel we
may well believe that its verification was even more
strikingly seen. In both ancient and modern times,
moreover, the human conscience has leaped up to justify
the belief that of all the sins committed without the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
this is the most heinous, and that there does rest upon it
in a peculiar manner the wrath of Almighty God. It is
a blasphemy against love in its earliest manifestations
to the soul, and only by answering love with love and
reverence can there be any fulfilling of the law.</p>

<p>After the fifth, the commandments deal with the purely
human relations; but in coming down from the duties
which men owe to God, this law escapes the sordidness
which seems to creep over the laws of other nations,
when they have to deal with the rights and duties of
men. The human rights are taken up rather into their
relation to God, and cease to be mere matters of bargain
and arrangement. They are viewed entirely from the
religious and moral standpoint. For example, the destruction
of human life, which in most cases was in ancient
times dealt with by private law, and was punished by
fines or money payments, is here regarded solely as a sin,
an act forbidden by God. The will of a holy God is the
source of these prohibitions, however much the idea of
property may extend in them beyond the limits which to
us now seem fitting. They begin with the protection of
a man's life, the highest of his possessions. Next, they
prohibit any injury to him through his wife, who next to
his life is most dear to him. Then property in our modern
sense is protected; and lastly, rising out of the merely
physical region, the ninth commandment prohibits any
attack upon a man's civil standing or honour by false
witness concerning him in the courts of justice. To that
crime Easterns are prone to a degree which Westerns,
whom Rome has trained to reverence for law, can hardly
realise. In India, at this hour, false witnesses can be
purchased in the open market at a trifling price; and under
native government the whole forces of civil justice become
instruments of the most remediless and exasperating
tyranny. So long as the law has not spoken its last word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<em>against</em> the innocent, there is hope of remedy; justice
may at last assert itself. But when, either by corrupt
witnesses or by a corrupt judge, the law itself inflicts the
wrong, then redress is impossible, and we have the
oppression which drives a wise man mad. Both murder
and robbery, moreover, may be perpetrated by false
swearing; and the trust, the confidence that social life
demands, is utterly destroyed by it.</p>

<p>But it is in the tenth commandment especially that this
code soars most completely away beyond others. In four
short words the whole region of neighbourly duty, so far
as acts are concerned, has been covered, and with that
other codes have been content. But the laws of Yahweh
must cover more than that. Out of the heart proceed all
these acts which have been forbidden, and Yahweh takes
knowledge of its thoughts and intents. The covetous
desire, the grasping after that which we cannot lawfully
have, that, too, is absolutely forbidden. It has been
pointed out that the first commandment also deals with
the thoughts. "Thou shalt have no other gods before
Me," separated from the prohibition of idol-worship, can
refer only to the inward adoration or submission of the
heart. And in this last commandment also it is the
evil desire, the lust which "bringeth forth sin," which is
condemned. In its beginning and ending, therefore, this
code transcends the limits ordinarily fixed for law; it
leads the mind to a view of the depth and breadth of the
evil that has to be coped with, which the other precepts,
taken by themselves and understood in their merely literal
sense, would scarcely suggest.</p>

<p>This fact should guard us against the common fallacy
that Moses and the people of his day could not have
understood these commandments in any sense except the
barely literal one. In the first and tenth commandments
there is involved the whole teaching of our Lord that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
that hateth his brother is a murderer. The evil thought
that first stirs the evil desire is here placed on the same
interdicted level as the evil deed; and though until our
Lord had spoken none had seen all that was implied,
yet here too He was only fulfilling, bringing to perfection,
that which the law as given by Moses had first outlined.
With this in view, it seems difficult to justify that interpretation
of the commandments which refuses all depth
of meaning to them. The initial and final references to
the inner thoughts of men, the delicate moral perception
which puts so unerring a finger on the sources of sin,
show that such literalism is out of place. No interpretation
can do this law justice which treats it superficially;
and instead of feeling safest when we find least in these
commandments, we should welcome from them all the
correction and reproof which a reasonable exegesis will
sustain.</p>

<p>Some of those who adopt the other view do so in the
interests of the authenticity of the commandments. They
say, We must be careful not to put into them any idea
which transcends what was possible in the days of Moses;
otherwise we must agree with those who bring down the
date of these marvellous ten words to the middle of the
seventh century <small>B.C.</small> But there is much ground for distrusting
modern judgments as to what men can have
thought and felt in earlier and ruder stages of society.
So long as the <em>na√Øve</em> interpretation of the state of man
before the fall prevailed, which Milton has made so
widely popular, the tendency was to exaggerate the
early man's moral and spiritual attainments. Now,
when the most degraded savages are taken as the truest
representatives of primitive man, the temptation is to
minimise both unduly. How often have we been told,
for example, that the Australian is the lowest of mankind,
and that he has no other idea of a spiritual world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
than that when he dies he will "jump up" a white
man! Yet Mr. A. W. Howitt,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> an unexceptionable
authority, as having himself been "initiated" among the
Australian blacks, tells us that they give religious and
moral instruction to their boys when they receive the
privileges of manhood. His words are: "The teachings
of the initiation are in a series of 'moral lessons,'
pantomimically displayed in a manner intended to be so
impressive as to be indelible. There is clearly a belief
in a Great Spirit, or rather an anthropomorphic Supernatural
Being, the 'Master of all,' whose abode is above
the sky, and to whom are attributed powers of omnipotence
and omnipresence, or, at any rate, the power 'to do
anything and to go anywhere.' The exhibition of his
image to the novices, and the magic dances round it,
approach very near to idol-worship. The wizards who
profess to communicate with him, and to be the mediums
of communication between him and his tribe, are not far
removed from an organised priesthood. To his direct
ordinance are attributed the spiritual and moral laws
of the community. Although there is no worship of
Daram√ºlun, as, for instance, by prayer, yet there is clearly
an invocation of him by name, and a belief that certain
acts please while others displease him." To most it
would have seemed absurd to attribute religious ideas of
such a kind to a people in the social and moral condition
of the Australian aborigines. Yet here we have the
testimony of a perfectly competent and reliable witness,
who, moreover, has no personal bias in favour of theologic
notions, to prove that even in their present state their
theology is of this comparatively advanced kind.</p>

<p>Many critics like Stade, and even Kuenen, would
deny to Israel in the days of Moses any conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Yahweh which would equal the Australian conception of
Daram√ºlun! Not to speak of the "regrettable vivacities"
of Renan in regard to Yahweh, Kuenen would deny to
the Mosaic Yahweh the title of Lord of all; he would
deny to Him the power "to go anywhere and to do
anything," binding Him strictly to His tribe and His land;
he would make His priests little more than the Australian
wizards; and purely moral laws like the Decalogue
Wellhausen would remove to a late date mainly because
such laws transcend the limits of the thought and
knowledge of the Mosaic time. But can any one believe
that Israel in the Mosaic time had lower beliefs than those
of the Australian aborigines? In every other respect
they had left far behind them the social state and the
merely embryonic culture of the Australian tribes. Moses
himself is an irrefragable proof of that. No such man
as he could have arisen among a people in the state of
the Australians. Even the fact that the Hebrews had
lived in Egypt, and had been compelled to do forced
labour for a long series of years, would of itself have
raised them to a higher stage of culture. Moreover they
built houses, and owned sheep and cattle, and must have
known at least the rudiments of agriculture. Indeed
Deut. xi. 10 asserts this, and the testimony of travellers
as to the habits of the tribes in the wilderness of the
wanderings now confirms it. Further, they had been
in contact with Egyptian religion, and they had been
surrounded by cults having more or less relation to the
ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia. Under such circumstances,
even apart from all revelation, it could not be
assumed that their religious ideas must needs correspond
to modern notions of the low type of primitive religions.
On the contrary, nothing but the clearest proof that their
religious conceptions were so surprisingly low should
induce us to believe it. On any supposition, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in the Mosaic time the first germs of what is now
universally admitted to be the highest form of religion.
Can we believe that only 1300 years <small>B.C.</small>, in the full light
of history, coming out of a land where the religion of the
people had been systematised and elaborated, not for
centuries, but for millenniums, and only 600 years before
the monotheistic prophets, a people at such a stage
of civilisation as the Hebrews can have had cruder
notions of Deity than the Wiraijuri and Wolgal tribes
of New South Wales!<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It may have been so; but
before we take it to have been so, we have a right to
demand evidence of a stringent kind, evidence which
leaves us no way of escape from a conclusion so
improbable.</p>

<p>Moreover the acceptance of the view now opposed does
not get rid of the necessity for supernatural enlightenment
in Israel. It only transfers it from an earlier to
a later time. For if the knowledge of Israel in Moses'
day was below the Wolgal standard, then it would seem
inexplicable that the ethical monotheism of the prophets
should have grown out of it by any merely natural process.
If there were no inspiration before the prophets,
though they believed and asserted there was, then their
own inspiration only becomes the more marvellous. It
is not needful to deny that the Hebrew tribes may at
some time have passed through the low stage of religious
belief of which these writers speak. But they err conspicuously
in regarding every trace of animistic and
fetichistic worship which can be unearthed in the
language, the ceremonies, and the habits of the Hebrews
at the Exodus, as evidence of the highest beliefs of the
people at that time. As a matter of fact, these were
probably mere survivals of a state of thought and feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
then either superseded or in the process of being so.
Besides, the mass of any people always lag far behind the
thoughts and aspirations of the highest thinkers of their
nation; and if we admit inspiration at all as a factor in
the religious development of Israel, the distance between
what Moses taught and believed himself, and what he
could get the mass of the people to believe and practise,
must have been still greater. If he gave the people the
ten commandments, he must have been far above them,
and dogmatic assertions as to what he can have thought
and believed ought to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Granting, however, that all we have found in the
Decalogue's conception of Yahweh was present to the
mind of Moses, and granting that the commands which
deal with the relations of men to each other are not
mere isolated prohibitions, but are founded upon moral
principles which were understood even then to have
much wider implications, there still remains a gap between
the widest meaning that early time could put into them,
and that which Luther's Catechism, or the Catechism
of the Westminster Divines, for example, asserts. The
question therefore arises whether these wider and more
detailed explanations, which make the Decalogue cover
the whole field of the moral and religious life, are
legitimate, and if so, on what principle can they be
justified? The reply would seem to be that they are
legitimate, and that the ten words did contain much more
than Moses or any of his nation for many centuries after
him understood. For any fruitful thought, any thought
which really penetrates the heart of things, must have in
it wider implications than the first thinker of it can have
conceived. If by any means a man has had insight to
see the central fact of any domain of thought and life,
its applications will not be limited to the comparatively
few cases to which he may apply it. He will generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
be content to deduce from his discovery just those
conclusions which in his circumstances and in his day
are practically useful and are most clamorously demanded.
But those who come after, pressed by new
needs, challenged by new experiences, and enlightened
by new thoughts in related regions, will assuredly find
that more was involved in that first step than any one
had seen. The scope of the fruitful principle will thus
inevitably widen with the course of things, and inferences
undreamed of by those who first enunciated the principle
will be securely drawn from it by later generations. Now
if that be true in regard to truths discovered by the
unassisted intellect of man, how much more true will it
be of thoughts which have first been revealed to man
under the influence of inspiration? Behind the human
mind which received them and applied them to the
circumstances which then had to be dealt with, there is
always the infinite mind which sees that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Far-off Divine event<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the whole creation moves."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The Divine purpose of the revelation must be the true
measure of the thoughts revealed, and the Divine purpose
can best be learned by studying the results as they have
actually evolved themselves in the course of ages.
Consequently, while the fundamental point in sound
interpretation of a book such as the Bible is to ascertain <em>first</em>
what the statements made therein signified to those who
heard them first, the second point is not to shut the mind to
the wider and more extensive applications of them which
the thought and experience of men, taught by the course
of history, have been induced, or even compelled, to make.
Both the narrower and the wider meanings are there,
and were meant to be found there. No exposition which
ignores either can be adequate.</p>

<p>That all works of God are to be dealt with in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
is beautifully demonstrated by Ruskin (<cite>Fors Clavigera</cite>,
Vol. I., Letter V.). In criticising the statement of a
botanist that "there is no such thing as a flower," after
admitting that in a certain sense the lecturer was right,
he goes on to say: "But in the deepest sense of all,
he was to the extremity of wrongness wrong; for leaf
and root and fruit exist, all of them, only&mdash;that there may
be flowers. He disregarded the life and passion of the
creature, which were its essence. Had he looked for
these, he would have recognised that in the thought of
nature herself, there is, in a plant, nothing else but
flowers." That means, of course, that the final perfection
of a development is the real and final meaning of it
all. Now any thought given by God in this special
manner which we call "inspiration" has in it a manifold
and varied life, and an end in view, which God alone
foresees. It works like leaven, it grows like a seed. It
is supremely living and powerful; and though it may
have begun its life, like the mustard seed, in a small and
lowly sphere, it casts out branches on all sides till its
entire allotted space is filled. So in the Decalogue; the
central chord in all the matters dealt with has been
touched with Divine skill, and all that has further to be
revealed or learned on that matter must lie in the line
of the first announcement.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, an illegitimate extension of the
meaning of the first commandment to say that it teaches
monotheism, nor of the second that it teaches the spirituality
of God, nor of the seventh that it forbids all
sensuality in thought or word or deed. It is true that
probably only the separateness of God was originally seen
to be asserted in the first, and the words may possibly
have been understood to mean that the "other gods"
referred to had some kind of actual life. The second,
too, may have seemed to be fulfilled when no earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
thing that was made by man was taken to represent
Yahweh. Lastly, those who say that nothing is forbidden
in the seventh commandment but literal adultery have
much to say for themselves. In a polygamous society
concubinage always exists. The absence of the more
flagrant of what in monogamous societies are called social
evils does not in the least imply the superior morality, such
as many who wish to disparage our Christian civilisation
have ascribed, for instance, to Mohammedans. The
degraded class of women who are the reproach and the
despair of our large towns are not so frequent in those
societies, because all women are degraded to nearer their
level than in monogamous lands. Both lust and vice are
more prevalent: and they are so because the whole level
of thought and feeling in regard to such matters is much
lower than with us.</p>

<p>Now, undoubtedly, ancient Israel was no exception to
this rule. In it, as a polygamous nation, there was a
licence in regard to sexual relations with women who
were neither married nor betrothed which would be
impossible now in any Christian community. It may be,
therefore, that only the married woman was specially
protected by this law. But in none of these cases did
the more rudimentary conception of the scope of the
commandments last. By imperceptible steps the sweep
of them widened, until finally the last consequences were
deduced from them, and they were seen to cover the
whole sphere of human duty. It may have been a long
step from the prohibition to put other gods along with
Yahweh to St. Paul's decisive word "An idol is nothing
in the world," but the one was from the first involved in
the other. Between "Thou shalt not make unto thee a
graven image" and our Lord's declaration "God is a Spirit,
and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth," there lies
a long and toilsome upward movement; but the first was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the gate into the path which must end in the second.
Similarly, the commandment which affirmed so strongly
the sacredness of the family, by hedging round the house-mother
with this special defence held implicit in it all
that rare and lovely purity which the best type of Christian
women exhibit. The principles upon which the
initial prohibitions were founded were true to fact and to
the nature both of God and man. They were, therefore,
never found at fault in the advancing stages of human
experience; and the meaning which a modern congregation
of Christians finds in these solemn "words," when they
are read before them, is as truly and justly their meaning
as the more meagre interpretation which alone ancient
Israel could put upon them.</p>

<p>How gradually, and how naturally, the advancing
thoughts and changed circumstances of Israel affected the
Decalogue may be seen most clearly in the differences
between its form as originally given, and as it is set forth
in Exodus and in Deuteronomy. If the original form of
these commandments was what we have indicated (p. 69),
they corresponded entirely to the circumstances of the
wilderness. There is no reference in them which presupposes
any other social background than that of a
people dwelling together according to families, possessing
property, and worshipping Yahweh. None of the commandments
involves a social state different from that.
But when Israel had entered upon its heritage, and had
become possessed of the oxen and asses which were
needed in agricultural labour and in settled life, this stage
of their progress was reflected in the reasons and inducements
which were added to the original commands. In
the fourth and tenth commandments of Exodus we have
consequently the essential commandments of the earlier
day adapted to a new state of things, <i>i.e.</i> to a settled
agricultural life. Then, even as between the Exodus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Deuteronomic texts, a progress is perceptible. The reasons
for keeping the Sabbath which these two recensions give
are different, as we have seen, and it is probable that the
reason given in Deuteronomy was first. To the people
in the wilderness came the bare Divine command that this
one day was to be sacred to Yahweh. In both Exodus
and Deuteronomy we have additions, going into details
which show that when these versions were prepared Israel
had ceased to be nomadic and had become agricultural.
In Deuteronomy we find that the importance and usefulness
of this command from a humane point of view had
been recognised, and one at least of the grounds upon
which it should be held a point of morality to keep it is
set forth in the words "that thy manservant and thy
maidservant may rest as well as thou." Finally, if the
critical views be correct, in Exodus we have the motive
for the observance of the Sabbath raised to the universal
and eternal, by being brought into connection with the
creative activity of God.</p>

<p>If the progression now traced out be real, then we have
in it a classical instance of the manner in which Divine
commands were given and dealt with in Israel. Given in
the most general form at first, they inevitably open the
way for progress, and as thought and experience grow in
volume and rise in quality, so does the understanding of
the law as given expand. Under the influence of this
expansion addition after addition is made, till the final
form is reached; and the whole is then set forth as having
been spoken by Yahweh and given by Moses when the
command was first promulgated. In such cases literary
proprietorship was never in question. Each addition was
sanctioned by revelation, and those by whom it came were
never thought of. It would seem, indeed, that nothing but
modern sceptical views as to the reality of revelation, the
feeling that all this movement to a higher faith was merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
natural, and that the hand of God was not in it, could
have suggested to the ancient Hebrew writers the wish
to hand on the names of those by whom such changes
were made. Yahweh spoke at the beginning, Moses
mediated between the people and Yahweh, and the law
thus mediated was in all forms equally Mosaic, and in all
forms equally Divine.</p>

<p>One other thing remains to be noticed, and that is the
prevailingly negative form of the commandments. Of
the ten only the fourth and fifth are in the affirmative.
All the others are prohibitions, and we who have been
taught by Christianity to put emphasis upon the positive
aspects of duty as the really important aspects of it,
may not improbably feel chilled and repelled by a
moral code which so definitely and prevailingly forbids.
But the cause of this is plain. A code like that of the
Twelve Tables published in early Rome is only occasionally
negative, because it rises to no great height in its
demands, and is intent only upon ordering the life of the
citizens in their outward conduct. But this code, which
seeks to raise the whole of life into the sacredness of a
continual service of God and man, must forbid, because
the first condition of such a life is the renunciation and
the restriction of self. Benevolent dreamers and theorists
of all ages, and men of the world whose moral standard
is merely the attainment of the average man, have denied
the evil tendency in man's nature. They have asserted
that man is born good; but the facts of experience are
entirely against them. Whenever a serious effort has
been made to raise man to any conspicuous height of
moral goodness, it has been found necessary to forbid him
to follow the bent of his nature. "Thou shalt not" has
been the prevailing formula; and in this sense original
sin has always been witnessed to in the world. Hence
the Old Testament, in which the most strenuous conflict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
for goodness which the world in those ages knew was
being carried on, could not fail, in every part of it, to
proclaim that man is not born good. However late we
may be compelled to put the writing of the story of the
fall as it stands in Genesis, there can be no question that
it represents the view of the Old Testament at all times.
Man is fallen; he is not what he ought to be, and the
evil taint is handed on from one generation to another.
Every generation, therefore, is called, by prophet and
priest and lawgiver alike, to the conflict against the
natural man.</p>

<p>The truth is that all along the leaders of Israel had a
quite overawing sense of the moral greatness of Yahweh
and of the stringency of His demands upon them. "Be
ye holy, for I am holy," was His demand; and so among
this people, as among no other, the sense of sin was
heightened, till it embittered life to all who seriously took
to heart the religion they professed. This feeling sought
relief in expiatory sacrifices, like the sin offering and
the guilt offering; but in vain. It then led to Pharisaic
hedging of the law, to seeking a positive precept for
every moment of time, to binding upon men's consciences
the most minute and burdensome prescriptions, as a
means of making them what they must be if they were
to meet the Divine requirements. But that too failed.
It became a slavery so intolerable that, when St. Paul
received the power of a new life, his predominant feeling
was that for the first time he knew what liberty meant.
He was set free from both the bondage of sin and the
bondage of ritual.</p>

<p>To the religious man of the Old Testament life was
a conflict against evil tendencies, a conflict in which defeat
was only too frequent, but from which there was no
discharge. It was fitting, therefore, that at the very beginning
of Israel's history, as the people of God, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
stern prohibition of the rougher manifestations of the
natural man should stand.</p>

<p>But it is characteristic of the Old Testament that
it states the fundamental fact, without any of the over-refinements
and exaggerations by which later doctrinal
developments have discredited it. There is no appearance
here, or anywhere in the Old Testament, of the Lutheran
exaggeration that man is by nature impotent to all good,
as a stock or a stone is. Keeping close to the testimony
of the universal conscience, the Decalogue, and the Old
Testament generally, speaks to men as those who can
be otherwise if they will. There is, further, a robust
assertion of righteous intention and righteous act on the
part of those whose minds are set to be faithful to God.
This may have been partly due to a blunter feeling in
regard to sin, and a less highly developed conscience,
but it was mainly a healthy assertion of facts which
ought not to be ignored. Yet, with all that, original sin
was too plain a fact ever to be denied by the healthy-minded
saints of the Old Testament. Fundamentally,
they held that human nature needed to be restrained, its
innate lawlessness needed to be curbed, before it could
be made acceptable to God.</p>

<p>Among the heathen nations that was not so. Take the
Greeks, for instance, as the highest among them. Their
watchword in morals was not repression, but harmonious
development. Every impulse of human nature was right,
and had the protection of a deity peculiarly its own.
Restraint, such as the Israelite felt to be his first
need, would have been regarded as mutilation by the
Greek, for he was dominated by no higher ideal than
that of a fully developed man. There was no vision
of unattainable holiness hovering always before his
mind, as there was before the mind of the Israelite.
God had not revealed Himself to him in power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
unalloyed purity, with a background of infinite wisdom
and omnipotence, so that unearthly love and goodness
were seen to be guiding and ruling the world. As
a consequence, the calling and destiny of man were
conceived by the Greeks in a far less soaring fashion
than by Israel. To put the difference in a few words,
man, harmoniously developed in all his powers and
passions and faculties, with nothing excessive about him,
was made God by the Greeks; whereas in Israel God was
brought down into human life to bear man's burden and
to supply the strength needed that man might become
like God in truth and mercy and purity. It is of course
true that both conceived of God under human categories.
They could not conceive God save by attributing to Him
that which they looked upon as highest in man. It is
also true that the higher natures in both nations, starting
thus differently, did in much approach each other. Still,
the immense difference remains, that the impulse in the
one case was given from the earth by dreams of human
perfection, in the other it came from above through men
who had seen God. The Greeks had seen only the glory
of man; Israel had seen the glory of God.</p>

<p>The result was that human nature as it is seemed to
the one much more worthy of respect and much less
seriously compromised than it did to the other. Comparing
man as he is, only with man as he easily might be, the
Greeks took a much less serious view of his state than
the Hebrews, who compared him with God as He had
revealed Himself. The former never attained any clear
conception of sin, and regarded it as a passing weakness
which could without much trouble be overcome. The
latter saw that it was a radical and now innate want of
harmony with God, which could only be cured by a new
life being breathed into man from above. And when
Europe became Christian, this difference made itself felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in very widespread religious and theological divergences.
In the South and among the Latin races the less
strenuous view of human disabilities&mdash;the view which
naturally grew out of the heathen conception of man
as, on the whole, born good, with no very arduous moral
heights to scale&mdash;has prevailed, and in those regions the
Pelagian form of doctrine has mastered the Christian
Church. But the Teutonic races have, in this matter,
shown a remarkable affinity with the Hebrew mind and
teaching. The deeper and more tragic view of the state
of man has commended itself to the Teutonic mind, and
the depth of the moral taint in the natural man has been
estimated according to the Biblical standard. It is not
only theologians among the Northern races who have been
thus affected. The higher imaginative literature of England
gives the same impression; and in our own day Browning,
our greatest poet, has emphasised his acceptance of the
Augustinian view of human nature by making its teaching
as to original sin a proof of the truth of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
At the end of his poem "Gold Hair: a Story of Pornic,"
in which he tells how a girl of angelic beauty, and of
angelic purity of nature as was supposed, is found after
her death to have sold her soul to the most gruesome
avarice, he says:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>But the Pagan view always reasserts itself; and modern
Hellenists especially, in their admiration of the grace
which does undoubtedly go with such conceptions of goodness
as the Greeks could attain, are apt to look askance
at the harshness and strenuousness which they find in the
Old Testament. For the most pathetic and pure of the
Greek conceptions of the gods are those which, like
Demeter, embody mother's love or some other natural
glory of humanity. Being thus natural, they are set before
us by the Greek imagination with an unconstrained
and graceful beauty which makes goodness appeal to the
√¶sthetic sense. To do this seems to many the supreme
achievement. Without this they hold that Christianity
would fail to meet the requirements of the modern heart
and mind, for to interest "taste" on the side of goodness is,
apparently, better than to let men feel the compulsion of
duty. Reasoning on such premisses, they claim that Greek
religion gave to Christianity its completion and its crown.
This is the claim advanced by Dyer in his <cite>Gods of Greece</cite>
(p. 19). "The Greek poets and philosophers," he says,
"are among our intellectual progenitors, and therefore the
religion of to-day has requirements which include all that
the noblest Greeks could dream of, requirements which
the aspirations of Israel alone could not satisfy. Our
complex life had need, not only of a supreme God of
power, universal and irresistible, of a jealous God beside
whom there was no other God, but also of a God of love
and grace and purity. To these ideal qualities, present in
the Diviner godhead of the Gospels, the evolution of Greek
mythology brought much that satisfies our hearts." The
best answer to that is to read Deuteronomy. The
Hebrews had no need to borrow "a God of love and
grace and purity" from Greek mythology. Centuries
before they came in contact with Greeks, their inspired
men had painted the love and grace and purity of God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the most attractive colours. Nor did they ever need to
unlearn the belief that Yahweh was merely a supreme
God of power. In the course of our exposition we shall
have occasion to see that the worship of mere power was
superseded by the religion of Yahweh from the first, and
that the author of Deuteronomy gives his whole strength
to demonstrate that the God of Israel is a "God of love
and grace and purity." But perhaps "grace" means to
Mr. Dyer "gracefulness." In that case we would deny
that "the Diviner godhead of the Gospels," as revealed in
Jesus Christ, had that √¶sthetic quality either. There is
no word of an appeal to the sense of the artistically
beautiful in anything recorded of Him; but neither in the
Old Testament nor the New is there any want of moral
beauty in the representation given of God. Moral beauty
alone has a central place in religion; and when beauty
that appeals to the senses intrudes into religion, it becomes
a source of weakness rather than of strength. There may
be a few people who can trust to their taste to keep them
firm in the pursuit of goodness, but the bulk of men have
always needed, and will always need, the severer compulsion
of duty. They need an objective standard; they need
a God, the embodiment and enforcer of all that duty
demands of them; and when they bend themselves to the
yoke of obligation thus imposed, they enter into a world
of heavenly beauty which seizes and enraptures the soul.
The mere √¶sthetic beauty of Greek mythology pales, for
the more earnest races of mankind at least, before this
Diviner loveliness, and it is the special gift of the Hebrew
as well as of the Teutonic races to be sensitive to it,
just as they fall behind others in √¶sthetic sensitiveness.
Wordsworth felt this, and has expressed it inimitably in
his "Ode to Duty"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stern Lawgiver! yet Thou dost wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Godhead's most benignant grace<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor know we anything so fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is the smile upon Thy face."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">That expresses the Hebrew feeling also. Drawn upwards
by the infinite and unchangeable love and goodness of
Yahweh, the Hebrews felt the clog of their innate sinfulness
as no other race has done. The stern "thou shalt
nots" of the Decalogue consequently found an echo in
their hearts. Won by the beauty of holiness, they gladly
welcomed the discipline of the Divine law, and by doing
so they established human goodness on a foundation
immeasurably more stable than any the gracefulness of
Greek imaginations could hope to lay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><i>THE MEDIATORSHIP OF MOSES</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> v. 22-33</h4>


<p>After the ten commandments, Deuteronomy, like
Exodus, next indicates that for all of legislation,
exhortation, and advice that follows, Moses was to be the
mediator between God and the people. He is represented
as Yahweh's prophet or speaker in all that succeeds; the
Decalogue alone is set forth as the direct Divine command.
Evidently a great distinction is here notified, and what it
exactly was may be best explained by reference to the
history of Roman law. In the earliest times that consisted
of <i>Fas</i>, <i>Jus</i>, and <i>Jus moribus constitutum</i>. In Chapter
IV. Professor Muirhead's description of fas has been given
at length, so that we need not repeat it here. The point
to remember is that it consisted of universal precepts such
as the Decalogue contains, given direct by God. <i>Jus</i>
again was, according to Breal, the Divine will declared by
human agency, and it occupied much the position which law
does in civilised states now. Finally, <i>jus moribus constitutum</i>,
or <i>boni mores</i>, was customary law, which had a twofold
function. "It was (1) a restraint upon the law, condemning,
though it could not prevent, the ruthless and unnecessary
exercise of legal right. (2) It was a supplement to law
(<i>jus</i>), requiring things law did not, <i>e.g.</i> dutiful service,
respect and obedience, chastity, fidelity to engagements,
etc." Now it is a striking fact that, though there can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
question of imitation here, the legislation of Deuteronomy
falls naturally into these very divisions; and that fact of
itself gives strong support to the belief that here in Israel,
as there in Rome, we have the recorded facts of the earliest
efforts at the regulation of national life. The <i>fas</i>, then,
corresponds to the Decalogue. The <i>jus</i> runs exactly
parallel with the laws in the strict sense of the term,
those which Moses received from Yahweh and afterwards
promulgated. Lastly, the <i>boni mores</i> are represented in
Deuteronomy by those beautiful precepts which limited
the exercise of legal right, and, going far beyond law,
demanded of Israel that they should make good their
claim to be Yahweh's people by justice, charity, and
purity.</p>

<p>To some it may seem that we do no service to
Scripture by insisting upon such a parallel. They will
feel as if thereby the unique character of the religion of
Israel as a revealed religion were obscured, if not obliterated.
But nothing can be imagined which could confirm
us in belief of the substantial accuracy of what we find
narrated of early times in Scripture, more than the
discovery that, without any possibility of collusion, the
earliest records of civilisation elsewhere give us precisely
the same account of the forms in which law first makes
its appearance. Surely we ought now to have learned this
lesson at least, that it is no disparagement to a Divinely
given system of law and religion, that its growth and
development run in the same channels as the growth and
development of similar systems which have none of the
marks of a Divine origin. Revelation always seizes upon
mind as it is, and makes that a sufficient and effective
channel for itself. However it is to be explained, it is
true that Divine action generally seeks to hide itself in the
ordinary course of human things as quickly as possible. It
is only at the moment of contact, or at the moment when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
has burst forth in some flower of more than earthly grace
and loveliness, or when it has overturned and overturned
until that state of things which has a right to endure
has been attained, that the Divine force reveals itself.
For the most part it sinks into the general sum of forces
that are making for the progress of humanity, and clothes
itself gladly in the uniform of other beneficent but natural
influences. Consequently it ought to be a welcome fact
that so close a parallel exists between the origins of
Roman law and the origins of Hebrew law. The one
great gain already mentioned, that it explains the early
appearance of the Decalogue, and shows that some such
laws would naturally be among the primary laws of Israel,
would be sufficient to justify that view; while in addition
the distinctions from the early laws of Rome help us to
classify in clear broad masses the somewhat disordered
series of Deuteronomic laws.</p>

<p>On one point only does the parallel seem questionable.
If we followed it alone as our guide, we should have to
set down the mediatorship of Moses, as a mere part of the
method, as belonging to the formal side only of the great
revelation. In other words, we should have to ask
whether the statement we have in Deut. v. 22-30 is
only an emotional and pictorial way of setting forth the
fact that, following and supplementing the elementary and
Divinely given Hebrew <i>fas</i>, there was also a Divinely
given but humanly mediated <i>jus</i>. But clearly it means
much more than that. By the earlier prophets, and
generally in all earlier delineations of him, Moses is
regarded as a prophet who had more direct and continuous
access to the Divine presence than any other prophet of
Israel. Moreover he had always been represented from
the earliest times as standing between Yahweh and His
people, holding on to the one and refusing to let the other
go. In the great scene, taken from the earliest constituents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the Pentateuch and narrated in Exod. xxxii.,
we see him anticipating by centuries the wonderful picture
of the Servant of God in Isa. liii., and by a still more
amazing stretch of time, that Divinest wish of St. Paul,
that he himself might be accursed even from Christ for his
brethren's sake. He thus stood between Yahweh and
His people both as the organ of Revelation and as the
self-forgetting intercessor, who suffered for sins not his
own, as well as for sins which his connection with his
nation had brought upon him; who, instead of repining,
was willing to be blotted out of God's book if that could
benefit his people.</p>

<p>This representation of Moses is not accidental. It is in
complete accord with a characteristic of Israelite literature
from beginning to end. In the earliest historical records
we find that the chief heroes of the nation are mediators,
standing for God in the face of evil men, and pleading
with God for men when they are broken and penitent, or
even when they are only terrified and restrained by the
terror of the Lord. At the beginning of the national
history we see the noble figure of Abraham in an agony
of supplication and entreaty before God on behalf of the
cities of the plain. At the end of it, we see the Christ,
the supreme "mediator between God and man," pouring
out His soul unto death for men "while they were yet
sinners," dying, the just for the unjust, taking upon
Himself the responsibility for the sin of man, and refusing
to let him wander away into permanent separation from
God. And all between is in accord with this. For it is
not Moses only who is regarded as having a mediatorial
office. The very people itself is set, by the promise given
to Abraham, in the same position. As early at least as
the eighth century it was put before Israel, that their
calling was not for their own sakes only, but that in them
all nations of the earth might be blessed. And at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
highest moments the prophets and teachers of Israel
always recognised this as their nation's part. Even when
they were being scattered among the heathen, it was that
they might be the means of bringing the knowledge of
Yahweh to the nations. From end to end of Scripture,
therefore, this conception is wrought into the very fibre of
its utterances. It is of the essence of the Biblical conception
of God that He should work among men by mediators.
In no other way could the primary Divine message be set
forth than by the prophetic voice; in no other way than
by the intercession and the suffering of those most in
harmony with the Divine will could any effective hold
upon God be given to His people. Only by those who
thus proved that they had seen Yahweh could His
character be expressed. Further, it was in this way that
Moses and the prophets, the rulers and the saints of
Israel, were types of Christ. They were not mere
puppets set forth in certain crises of Israel's history to go
through a certain career, live a certain life, and pass into
and out of a number of scenes, in order that they might
afford us, upon whom the end of the world has come,
pictorial proofs that all things in this history were pressing
towards and converging upon Christ. That would be a
very artificial way of conceiving the matter. No, each of
these types was a real man, with real tasks of his own to
accomplish in the world. Not only were they all real
men, they were the leading men of their various times.
They bore the burden of their day more than others;
they were the special organs of Divine power and grace;
and their lives were spent in giving impulse and direction
to the movements of their people's life towards the strange,
unlooked-for consummation appointed for it. They were
types of Christ, they gave promise of Him, not because of
mere arbitrary appointment or selection, but because they
did in their day, in a lower degree and at an earlier stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the very same work that He did. Further, the whole
nation was a type of Christ in so far as it was true to its
calling at all. It was the prophet and the priest among
nations. It spread abroad the knowledge of Him, and it
died at last as a nation that life might be given to the
world. Both Israel and all the men who truly represented
it were partakers in the labours and in the sufferings of
Christ beforehand, just as Christians are said to fill up
the measure of His sufferings now. The mediatorial
character of Moses, therefore, was essential. It is no
merely formal thing, nor an afterthought. He would
have been no fit founder of the mediatorial nation had he
not been a mediator himself, for not otherwise could he
have helped to realise the Abrahamic promise.</p>

<p>But there is another subsidiary reason why a mediator
was necessary to Israel at this stage. Behind all that
Moses taught his people lay necessarily the ancient
popular religion of the Hebrews. Now, except in so far
as it may have been changed in Egypt, that was in its
main features the same as the religion of the other
nomadic tribes of Semitic stock, for the Abrahamic faith
was, clearly, known but to few. But the names given
to their deities by these people&mdash;such as Baal, Adhonai,
Milcom, etc.&mdash;"all expressed submission to the irresistible
power revealing itself in nature," just as "Islam," which
means "submission," indicates that Mohammedanism is
a mere perpetuation of this view.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Consequently the
Israelite people were unable to conceive God save as a
devouring presence, before which no man could live.
The Mosaic view was, in itself, immeasurably higher, and,
besides that, it opened up the path to attainments then
inconceivable. Moses therefore had to stand alone in
his new relation to God, while the people cowered away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in terror, dominated entirely by the lower conception.
They could not stand where he stood. They were unable
to believe that power was not Yahweh's only attribute;
while Moses had had revealed to him, in germ at least,
that God was "merciful and gracious, longsuffering and
slow to anger," and that a life passed in His presence
was the ideal life for man. Both the Yahwistic narrative
in Exodus and the repetition of it in Deuteronomy give
the same representation of the events at Sinai, and indicate
quite clearly that, while the old relation to God was in
itself good so far, it was to be superseded by that higher
relation in which Moses stood. That is the meaning of
the words in Deut. v. 28, 29: "And Yahweh said unto
me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people
which they have spoken unto thee; they have well said
all that they have spoken. Oh that there were such a
heart in them, that they would fear Me and keep all
My commandments, always, that it might be well with
them and with their children for ever!" The parallel
passage in Exodus is xx. 20: "And Moses said unto
the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you,
and that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not."
In both, the standpoint of fear is approved as relatively
good and wholesome. It was well that the people should
have this awestruck fear of the Divine, for it would act
as a deterrent from sin. But it was not sufficient. It
was only the starting-point for the attainments which
Yahweh by Moses, and in Moses, was about to call and
incite them to. Moses therefore had to stand between
Israel and Yahweh in this too, that he had entered into
and lived in relations with his God which they were as
yet unable either to conceive or to endure.</p>

<p>It is well to add, also, that in giving approval of this
kind to fear as a religious motive these early teachers
were entirely in accord with the final development of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Israelite religion in the New Testament. The modern
view that any appeal to fear in religion or morality is
degrading would have been simply unintelligible to the
Biblical writers. Even now, the whole fabric of society,
the state with its officials and the law with its penalties,
are a continual protest against it in the realm of practical
morality. In truth the conflict raised about this matter
in modern times is simply a conflict between superfine
theories and facts. Now the Old Testament is throughout
supremely true to the facts of human nature and human
experience. It is practically a transcript of them as seen
in the light of revelation. In a time, therefore, when in
morals and religion physical fact is being allowed to
override or pervert psychical fact, the Old Testament view
is peculiarly wholesome. It helps to restore the balance
and to keep man's thoughts sane.</p>

<p>Another point on which this narrative of Deuteronomy
corrects and restores that which the tendency of modern
thought has perverted is an even more important one.
We have seen that the Old Testament view, as stated
here, and as it is interwoven with the central fibres of
the Old Testament conception, is that all men who are
called to the task of permanently raising the level of
human life and thought must give not only their light to,
but their life for, those whom they seek to win for God.
They must ask nothing from mankind but ever widening
opportunities for service and self-sacrifice. But in our
modern day this has been precisely reversed, and men
like Goethe and Schopenhauer, and even Carlyle, have
demanded that mankind should yield service to them, and
then, by the furtherance and development they thereby
attain, they promise to work out the deliverance of men
from superstition and unreality and the bondage of
ignorance. Goethe in this matter is typical. He preached
and practised in the most uncompromising manner the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
doctrine of self-development. He thought that he could
serve humanity in no way so well as by making every one
he met, and all the experiences he encountered, minister
to his own intellectual growth. Instead of saying with
Moses, "Blot me out of Thy book," but spare these dim
idolatrous masses, he would have said, "Let them all perish,
and let me become the origin of a wiser, more intellectual,
more self-restrained race than they." He consequently
pursued his own ends relentlessly from his early years,
and attained results so immense that almost every
domain of thought, speculation, and science is now under
some debt to him. But for all purposes of inspiring
moral and spiritual enthusiasm he is practically useless.
His selfishness, however high its kind, accomplished its
work and left him cold, unapproachable, isolated. This
want of love for men made him the accurate critic of
human nature, but left him blind in great degree and
hopeless altogether in regard to those possibilities of
better things which are never wholly wanting to it. The
result is that, notwithstanding his heroic powers, his
influence is to-day rather a minus quantity in the spiritual
and moral life. No one who has not warmth from other
sources pouring in upon him can have much communion
with Goethe without losing vitality, and in his presence
the Divine passion of self-sacrificing love looks out of
place, or even slightly absurd. His power is fascinating,
but it freezes all the sources of the nobler spiritual
emotions, and ultimately must tend to the impoverishing
of human nature and the lowering of the level of human
life. No; men are not to be reached so if it is wished
to raise them to their highest powers, and all experience
proves that the New Testament was right in summing
up the teaching of the Old by the words, "He that saveth
his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life for My
sake shall find it."</p>

<h3><i>LOVE TO GOD THE LAW OF LIFE</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> vi. 4, 5</h4>


<p>In these verses we approach "the commandments, the
statutes, and the judgments" which it was to be
Moses' duty to communicate to the people, <i>i.e.</i> the second
great division of the teaching and guidance received at
Sinai. But though we approach them we do not come
to them for a number of chapters yet. We reach them
only in chapter xii., which begins with almost the same
words as chapter vi. What lies between is a new exhortation,
very similar in tone and subject to that into
which chapters i-iii. have been transformed.</p>

<p>To some readers in our day this repetition, and the
renewed postponement of the main subject of the book,
have seemed to justify the introduction of a new author
here. They are scornfully impatient of the repetition
and delay, especially those of them who have themselves
a rapid, dashing style; and they declare that the
writer of the laws, etc., from chapter xii. onwards
cannot have been the writer of these long double introductions.
<em>They</em> would not have written so; consequently
no one else, however different his circumstances, his
objects, and his style may be, can have written so. It
is true, they admit, that the style, the grammar, the
vocabulary are all exactly those of the purely legal
chapters, but that matters not. Their irritation with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
delay is decisive; and so they introduce us, entirely on
the strength of it, to another Deuteronomist, second or
third or fourth&mdash;who knows? But all this is too purely
subjective to meet with general acceptance, and we may
without difficulty decide that the linguistic unity of the
book, when chapters vi. to xii. are compared with what
we find after xii., is sufficient to settle the question of
authorship.</p>

<p>But we have now to consider the possible reasons for
this second long introduction. The first introduction has
been satisfactorily explained in a former chapter; this
second one can, I think, quite as easily be accounted
for. The object of the book is in itself a sufficient
explanation. To modern critical students of the Old
Testament the laws are the main interest of Deuteronomy.
They are the material they need for their reconstruction
of the history of Israel, and they feel as if all besides,
though it may contain beautiful thoughts, were irrelevant.
But that was not the writer's point of view at all.
For him it was not the main thing to introduce new
laws. He was conscious rather of a desire to bring old
laws, well known to his fellow-countrymen, but neglected
by them, into force again. Anything new in his version
of them was consequently only such an adaptation of
them to the new circumstances of his time as would tend
to secure their observance. Even if Moses were the
author of the book this would be true; but if a prophetic
man in Manasseh's day was the author, we can see how
naturally and exclusively that view would fill his mind.
He had fallen upon evil times. The best that had been
attained in regard to spiritual religion had been deliberately
abandoned and trodden under foot. Those who
sympathised with pure religion could only hope that a
time would come when Hezekiah's work would be taken
up again. If Deuteronomy was written in preparation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that time, the legal additions necessary to ward off the
evils which had been so nearly fatal to Yahwism would
seem to the author much less important than they appear
to us to be. His object was to retrieve what had been
lost, to rouse the dead minds of his countrymen, to
illustrate that on which the higher life of the nation
depended, and to throw light upon it from all the sources
of what then was modern thought. His mind was full of
the high teaching of the prophets. He was steeped in
the history of his people, which was then receiving, or
was soon to receive, its all but final touches. He was
intensely anxious that in the later time for which he was
writing all men should see how Providence had spoken
for the Mosaic law and religion, and what the great
principles were which had always underlain it, and which
had now at last been made entirely explicit.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it was not merely natural
that the author of Deuteronomy should dwell with insistence
upon the hortatory part of his book; it was
necessary. He could not feel Wellhausen's haste to
approach his restatement of the law. To him the
exhortation was, in fact, the important thing. Every day
he lived he must have seen that it was not want of
knowledge that misled his contemporaries. He must
have groaned too often under the weight of the indifference
even of the well disposed not to be aware that that
was the great hindrance to the restoration of the better
thoughts and ways of Hezekiah's day.</p>

<p>He had learned by bitter experience, what every man
who is in earnest about inducing masses of men to take
a step backward or forward to a higher life always learns,
that nothing can be accomplished till a fire has been
kindled in the hearts of men which will not let them
rest. To this task the author of Deuteronomy devotes
himself. And whatever impatient theorists of to-day may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
say, he succeeds amazingly. His exhortation touches
men from one end of the world to the other, even to this
day, by its affectionate impressiveness. His exhibition of
the principles underlying the law is so true that, when
our Lord was asked, "Which is the first commandment
of all?" He answered from this chapter of Deuteronomy:
"The first of all the commandments is this, The Lord our
God is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
thy strength. The second is this, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment
greater than these." Now these are precisely the truths
Deuteronomy exhibits in these prefatory chapters, and
it is by them that the after-treatment of the law is
permeated. The author of Deuteronomy by announcing
these truths brought the Old Testament faith as near to
the level of the New Testament faith as was possible;
and we may well believe that he saw his work in its
true relative proportions. The hortatory chapters are
really the most original part of the book, and exhibit
what was most permanent in it. The mere fact that the
author lingers over it, therefore, is entirely inadequate to
justify us in admitting a later hand. Indeed, if criticism
is to retain the respect of reasonable men, it will have to
be more sparing than it has hitherto been with the "later
hand"; to introduce it here under the circumstances is
nothing short of a blunder.</p>

<p>In our verses, therefore, we have to deal with the main
point of our book. Coming immediately after the
Decalogue, these words render explicit the principle of the
first table of that law. In them our author is making
it clear that all he has to say of worship, and of the
relation of Israel to Yahweh, is merely an application
of this principle, or a statement of means by which a
life at the level of love to God may be made possible or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
secured. This section, therefore, forms the bridge which
connects the Decalogue with the legal enactments which
follow; and it is on all accounts worthy of very special
attention. Our Lord's quotation of it as the supreme
statement of the Divine law, in its Godward aspect, would
in itself be an overwhelmingly special reason for thorough
study of it, and would justify us in expecting to find it one
of the deepest things in Scripture.</p>

<p>The translation of the first clause presents difficulties.
The Authorised Version gives us, "Hear, O Israel: The
Lord our God is one Lord," but that can no longer be
accepted, since it rests upon the Jewish substitution of
Adhonai for Yahweh. Taking this view of the construction,
it should be rendered, "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our
God is one Yahweh"; and this is the meaning which most
recent authorities&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> Knobel, Keil, and Dillmann&mdash;put
upon it. But equally good authorities&mdash;such as Ewald
and Oehler&mdash;render, "Yahweh our God&mdash;Yahweh is one."
This is unobjectionable grammatically. Still another
translation, "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh is our God, Yahweh
alone," has been received by the most recent and most
scholarly German translation of the Scripture, that edited
by Kautzsch. But the objection that in that case <i>l'bhaddo</i>,
not <i>'echƒÅdh</i>, should have been used, seems conclusive
against it. The two others come very much to the same
thing in the end, and were it not for the time at which
Deuteronomy was written, Ewald's translations would be
the simpler and more acceptable. But the first&mdash;"Yahweh
our God is one Yahweh"&mdash;exactly meets the circumstances
of that time, and moreover emphasises that in Israel's
God which the writer of Deuteronomy was most anxious
to establish. As against the prevailing tendency of the
time, he not only denies polytheism, or, as Dillmann puts
it, asserts the concrete fact that the true God cannot be
resolved in the polytheistic manner into various kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and shades of deity, like the Baalim, but he also prohibits
the amalgamation or partial identification of Him with
other gods. Though very little is told us concerning
Manasseh's idolatry, we know enough to feel assured that
it was in this fashion he justified his introduction of
Assyrian deities into the Temple worship. Moloch, for
example, must in some way have been identified with
Yahweh, since the sacrifices of children in Tophet are
declared by Jeremiah to have been to Yahweh. Further,
the worship at the High Places had led, doubtless, to
belief in a multitude of local Yahwehs, who in some obscure
way were yet regarded as one, just as the multitudinous
shrines of the Virgin in Romanist lands lead to the
adoration of our Lady of Lourdes, our Lady of √âtaples,
and so on, though the Church knows only one Virgin
Mother. This incipient and unconscious polytheism it
was our author's purpose to root out by his law of one
altar; and it seems congruous, therefore, that he should
sum up the first table of the Decalogue in such a way as
to bring out its opposition to this great evil. Of course
the oneness of deity as such is involved in what he says;
but the aspect of this truth which is specially put forward
here is that Yahweh, being God, is one Yahweh, with no
partners, nor even with variations that practically destroy
unity. No proposition could have been framed more
precisely and exactly to contradict the general opinion of
Manasseh and his followers regarding religion; and in it
the watchword of monotheism was spoken. Since it was
uttered, this has been the rallying point of monotheistic
religion, both among Jews and Mohammedans. For
"there is no God but God" is precisely the counterpart
of "Yahweh is one Yahweh"; and from one end of the
civilised world to the other this strenuous confession
of faith has been heard, both as the tumultuous battle-shout
of victorious armies, and as the stubborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and immovable assertion of the despised, and scattered,
and persecuted people to whom it was first revealed.
Even to-day, though in the hands of both Jews and
Mohammedans it has been hardened into a dogma which
has stripped the Mosaic conception of Yahweh of those
elements which gave it possibilities of tenderness and
expansion, it still has power over the minds of men. Even
in such hands, it incites missionary effort, and it appeals
to the heart at some stages of civilisation as no other creed
does. It makes men, nay, even civilised men, of the wild
fetich-worshipping African; but for want of what follows
in our context it leaves them stranded&mdash;at a higher level, it
is true, but stranded nevertheless&mdash;without possibilities of
advance, and exposed to that terrible decay in their moral
and spiritual conceptions which sooner or later asserts
itself in every Mohammedan community.</p>

<p>Israel was saved from the same spiritual disease by
the great words which succeed the assertion of Yahweh's
oneness. The writer of Deuteronomy did not desire to
set forth this declaration as an abstract statement of
ultimate truth about God. He makes it the basis of a
quite new, a quite original demand upon his countrymen.
Because Yahweh thy God is one Yahweh, "thou shalt
love Yahweh thy God with all thine heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might." To us, who have
inherited all that was attained by Israel in their long
and eventful history as a nation, and especially in its
disastrous close, it may have become a commonplace
that God demands the love of His people. But if so,
we must make an effort to shake off the dull yoke of
custom and familiarity. If we do, we shall see that it
was an extraordinarily original thing which the Deuteronomist
here declares. In the whole of the Old Testament
there are, outside of Deuteronomy, thirteen passages in
which the <i>love</i> of men to Yahweh is spoken of. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Exod. xx. 6; Josh. xxii. 5, xxiii. 11; Judges v. 31;
1 Kings iii. 3; Neh. i. 5; Psalms xviii. 2, xxxi. 24,
xci. 14, xcvii. 10, cxvi. 1, cxlv. 20; and Dan. ix. 4. Now
of these the verses from Nehemiah and Daniel are manifestly
later than Deuteronomy, and of the Psalms only
the eighteenth can with any confidence be assigned to a
time earlier than the seventh century <small>B.C.</small> All the others
may with great probability be assigned at earliest to the
times of Jeremiah and the post-exilic period. Three of
the passages from the historic books again&mdash;Josh. xxii. 5,
xxiii. 11; 1 Kings iii. 3&mdash;are attributed, on grounds largely
apart from the use of this expression, to the Deuteronomic
editor, <i>i.e.</i> the writer who went over the historical books
about 600 <small>B.C.</small>, and made slight additions here and there,
easily recognisable by their differing in tone and feeling
from the surrounding context. Indeed Josh. xxii. 5 is a
palpable quotation from Deuteronomy itself.</p>

<p>Of the thirteen passages, therefore, only three&mdash;Exod.
xx. 6, Judges v. 31, and Psalm xviii. 2&mdash;belong to the time
previous to Deuteronomy, and in all three the mention
of love to God is only allusive, and, as it were, by the way.
Before Deuteronomy, consequently, there is little more
than the mere occurrence of the word. There is nothing
of the bold and decisive demand for love to the one God
as the root and ground of all true relations with Him
which Deuteronomy makes. At most, there is the hint
of a possibility which might be realised in the future; of
love to God as the permanent element in the life of man
there is no indication; and it is this which the author of
Deuteronomy means, and nothing less than this. He
makes this demand for love the main element of his
teaching. He returns to it again and again, so that there
are almost as many passages bearing on this in Deuteronomy
as in the whole Old Testament besides; and the
particularity and emphasis with which he dwells upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
are immeasurably greater. Only in the New Testament
do we find anything quite parallel to what he gives us;
and there we find his view taken up and expanded, till
love to God flashes upon us from almost every page as
the test of all sincerity and the guarantee of all success
in the Christian life.</p>

<p>To proclaim this truth was indeed a great achievement;
and when we remember the abject fear with which Israel
had originally regarded Yahweh, it will appear still more
remarkable that the book embodying this should have
been adopted by the whole people with enthusiasm, and
that with it should begin the Canon of Holy Scripture;
for Deuteronomy, as all now recognise, was the first book
which became canonical. I have said that the conception
was an extraordinarily original one, and have pointed out
that it had not been traceable to any extent previously in
Israel's religious books or its religious men. It will
appear still more original, I think, if we consider what
a growth in moral and spiritual stature separates the
Israel of Moses' day and that of Josiah's; what the
attitude of other nations to their gods was in contrast
to this; and, lastly, what it involves and implies, as
regards the nature of both God and man.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the earlier narratives represent
the men to whom Moses spoke as acknowledging that
they could not, as yet at any rate, bear to remain in the
presence of Yahweh. Between their God and them,
therefore, there could be no relation of love properly so
called. There was reverence, awe, and chiefly fear,
tempered by the belief that Yahweh as their God was
on their side. He had proved it by delivering them from
the oppressions of Egypt, and they acknowledged Him
and were jealous for His honour and submissive to His
commands. So far as the record goes, that would
seem to have been their religious state. Progress from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that state of mind to a higher, to a demand for direct
personal relations between each individual Israelite and
Yahweh, was not easy. It was hindered by the fact that
Israel as a whole, and not the individual, was for a long
time regarded as the subject of religion. That, of course,
was no hindrance to the development of the thought that
Yahweh loved Israel; but so long as that conception
dominated religious thought in Israel, so long was it
impossible to think of individual love and trust as the
element in which each faithful man should live.</p>

<p>But the love of Yahweh was declared, century after
century, by prophet and priest and psalmist, to be set
upon His people, and so the way for this demand for love
on man's part was opened. Man's relations with God
began to grow more intimate. The distance lessened,
as the use of the words "them that love Me" in the
song of Deborah and the Davidic word in Psalm xviii.,
"I love thee, Yahweh my rock," clearly show. Hosea
next took up the strain, and intensified and heightened
it in a wonderful manner, but the nation failed to
respond adequately. In the later prophets the love
and grace and longsuffering of Yahweh and His ceaseless
efforts on behalf of Israel are continually made
the ground of exhortations, entreaties, and reproaches;
but, as a whole, the people still did not respond. We
may be sure, however, that an ever increasing minority
were affected by the clearness and intensity of the
prophetic testimony. To this minority, the Israel within
Israel, the remnant that was to return from exile and
become the seed of a people that should be all righteous,
the love of Yahweh tended to become His main characteristic.
That love sustained their hopes; and though the
awe and reverence which were due to His holiness, and the
fear called forth by His power, still predominated, there
grew up in their hearts a multitude of thoughts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
expectations tending more and more to the love of
God.</p>

<p>As yet it was only a timid reaching out towards Him,
a hope and longing which could hardly justify itself. Yet
it was robust enough not to be killed by disappointment,
by hope deferred, or even by crushing misfortune; and
in the furnace of affliction it became stronger and more
pure. And in the heart of the author of Deuteronomy
it grew certain of itself, and soared up with an eagerness
that would not be denied. Then, as always where God
is the object of it, love that dares was justified; and out
of its restless and timid longings it came to the "place of
rest imperturbable, where love is not forsaken if itself
forsaketh not."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> From knowledge, confirmed by the
answering love and inspiration of God, and impelled
consciously by Him, he then in this book made and
reiterated his great demand. All spiritual men found in
it the word they had needed. They responded to it
eagerly when the book was published; and their enthusiasm
carried even the torpid and careless masses with
them for a time. The nation, with the king at their head,
accepted the legislation of which this love to God was the
underlying principle, and so far as public and corporate
action can go, Israel adopted the deepest principle of
spiritual life as their own.</p>

<p>Of course with the mass this assent had little depth;
but in the hearts of the true men in Israel the joy and
assurance of their great discovery, that Yahweh their
God was open to, nay, desired and commanded, their most
fervent affection, soon produced its fruit. From the
fragments of the earliest legislation which have come
down to us, it is obvious that the Mosaic principles had
led to a most unwonted consideration for the poor. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
later days, though the ingrained tendency to oppression,
which those who have power in the East seem quite
unable to resist, did its evil work in both Israel and
Judah, there were never wanting prophetic voices to
denounce such villainy in the spirit of these laws. The
public conscience was thereby kept alive, and the ideal of
justice and mercy, especially to the helpless, became a
distinguishing mark of Israelite religion. But it was in
the minds of those who had learned the Deuteronomist's
great lesson, and had taken example by him, that the love
which came from God, and had just been answered back
by man overflowed in a stream of blessing to man's
"neighbours." Deuteronomy had uttered the first and
great commandment; but it is in the Law of Holiness,
that complex of ancient laws brought together by the
author of P, and found now mainly in Lev. xvii.-xxvi.,
that we find the second word, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> If we ask, Who is my neighbour? we
find that not even those beyond Israel are excluded, for in
Lev. xix. 34 we read, "The stranger that sojourneth with
you shall be unto you as the homeborn among you, and
thou shalt love him as thyself." The idea still needed
the expansion which it received from our Lord Himself
in the parable of the Good Samaritan; but it is only one
step from these passages to the New Testament.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of mere fear, then, to the standpoint
of love which casteth out fear, even the masses of
Israel were lifted, in thought at least, by the love and
teaching of God. And the process by which Israel was led
to this height has proved ever since to be the only possible
way to such an attainment. It began in the free favour
of God, it was continued by the answer of love on the part
of man, and these antecedents had as their consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the proclamation of that law of liberty&mdash;for self-renouncing
love is liberty&mdash;"Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself." Without the first, the second
was impossible; and the last without the other two
would have been only a satire upon the incurable selfishness
of man. It is worthy of remark, at least, that only
on the critical theory of the Old Testament is each of
these steps in the moral and religious education of Israel
found in its right place, with its right antecedents; only
when taken so do the teachers who were inspired to
make each of these attainments find circumstances
suited to their message, and a soil in which the germs
they were commissioned to plant could live.</p>

<p>But great as is the contrast between the Israel of
Moses' day and that of Josiah's, it is not so great as the
contrast between the religion of Israel in the Deuteronomic
period and the religion of the neighbouring nations.
Among them, at our date 650 <small>B.C.</small>, there was, so far as
we know them, no suggestion of personal love to God
as an effective part of religion. In the chapters on the
Decalogue the main ideas of the Canaanites in regard to religion
have been described, so that they need not be repeated
here. I shall add only what E. Meyer says of their gods:
"With advancing culture the cultus loses its old simplicity
and homeliness. A fixed ritual was developed&mdash;founded
upon old hereditary tradition. And here the gloomier
conception became the ruling one, and its consequences
were inexorably deduced. The great gods, even the protecting
gods of the tribe or the town, are capricious and
in general hostile to man&mdash;possibly to some degree because
of the mythological conception of Baal as sun-god&mdash;and
they demand sacrifices of blood that they may be
appeased. In order that evil may be warded off from
those with whom they are angry, another human being
must be offered to them as a substitute in propitiatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sacrifice&mdash;nay, they demand the sacrifice of the firstborn,
the best-loved son. If the community be threatened with
the wrath of the deity, then the prince or the nobility as
a whole must offer up their children on its behalf."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This
also is the view of Robertson Smith,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> who considers that
while in their origin the Semitic religions involved kindly
relations and continual intercourse between the gods and
their worshippers, these gradually disappeared as political
misfortune began to fall upon the smaller Semitic peoples.
Their gods were angry and in the vain hope of appeasing
them men had recourse to the direst sacrifices. Hints
concerning these had survived from times of savagery;
and to the diseased minds of these terror-stricken peoples
the more ancient and more horrible a sacrifice was the
more powerful did it seem. At this time, therefore, the
course of the Canaanite religions was away from love to
their gods. The decay of nationality brought despair,
and the frantic efforts of despair, into the religion of the
Canaanite peoples; but to Israel it brought this higher
demand for more intimate union with their God. Whatever
elements tending towards love the Canaanite religions
originally may have had, they had either been mingled
with the corrupting sensuality which seems inseparable
from the worship of female deities, or had been limited
to the mere superficial good understanding which their
participation in the same common life established between
the people and their gods. Their union was largely independent
of moral considerations on either side. But in
Israel there had grown up quite a different state of things.
The union between Yahweh and His people had from the
days of the Decalogue taken a moral turn; and gradually
it had become clear that to have Abraham for their father
and Yahweh for their God would profit them little, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
they did not stand in right moral relations and in moral
sympathy with Him. Now, in Deuteronomy, that fundamentally
right conception of the relation between God and
man received its crown in Yahweh's claim to the love of
His people. No contrast could be greater than that which
common misfortune and a common national ruin produced
between the surrounding Semitic peoples and Israel.</p>

<p>But besides the small kingdoms which immediately
surrounded Palestine, Israel had for neighbours the two
great empires of Egypt and Assyria. She was exposed
therefore to influence from them in even a greater degree.
Long before the Exodus, the land which Israel came afterwards
to occupy had been the meeting-place of Babylonian
and Egyptian power and culture. In the fifteenth century
<small>B.C.</small> it was under the suzerainty if not the direct sovereignty
of Egypt; but its whole culture and literature, for it must
have had books, as the name Kirjath-Sepher (Book-town)
shows, was Babylonian. Throughout Israel's history,
moreover, Assyrian and Egyptian manners and ways of
thought were pressed upon the people; and we cannot
doubt that in regard to religion also their influence was
felt. But at this period, as in the Canaanite religions, so
also in those of Assyria and Egypt, the tendency was
altogether different from what Deuteronomy shows it to
have been in Israel.</p>

<p>In regard to Egypt this is somewhat difficult to prove,
for the Egyptian religion is so complicated, so varied, and
so ancient, that men who have studied it despair of tracing
any progress in it. A kind of monotheism, polytheism,
fetichism, animism, and nature-worship such as we find
in the Vedas, have in turn been regarded as its primitive
state; but as a matter of fact all these systems of religious
thought and feeling are represented in the earliest records,
and they remained constant elements of it till the end.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Whatever had once formed part of it, Egyptian religion
clung to with extraordinary tenacity. As time went on,
however, the accent was shifted from one element to the
other, and after the times of the XIXth dynasty, <i>i.e.</i> after
the time of the Exodus, it began to decay. A systematised
pantheism, of which sun-worship was the central element,
was elaborated by the priests; the moral element which
had been prominent in the days when the picture of the
judgment of the soul after death was so popular in Thebes
retired more into the background, and the purely magical
element became the principal one. Instead of moral goodness
and the fulfilment of duty being the main support of
the soul in its dread and lonely journeys in the "world
of the Western sky," knowledge of the proper formulas
became the chief hope, and the machinations of evil
demons the main danger. In the royal tombs at Thebes
the walls of the long galleries are covered with representations
of these demons, and the accompanying writing
gives directions as to the proper formulas by knowledge
of which deliverance can be secured. This, of course,
confined the benefits of religion, so far as they related to
the life to come, to the educated, and the wealthy. For
these secret spells were hard to obtain, and had to be
purchased at a high price. As Wiedemann says, "Still
more important than in this world was the knowledge of
the correct magical words and formulas in the other world.
No door opened here if its name was not known, no
d√¶mon let the dead pass in if he did not address him
in the proper fashion, no god came to his help so long as
his proper title was not given him, no food could be procured
so long as the exactly prescribed words were not
uttered."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The people were therefore thrown back upon
the ancient popular faith, which needed gods only for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
practical life, and honoured them only because they were
mighty.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Some of them were believed to be friendly; but
others were malevolent deities who would destroy mankind
if they did not mollify them by magic, or render
them harmless by the greater power of the good gods.
Consequently Set, the unconquerable evil demon, was
worshipped with zeal in many places. With him there
were numerous demons, "the enemies," "the evil ones,"
which lie in wait for individuals, and threaten their life
and weal. The main thing, therefore, was to bring the
correct sacrifices, to use such formulas and perform such
acts as would render the gods gracious and turn away
evil. Moreover the whole of nature was full of spirits,
as it is to the African of to-day, and in the mystic texts
of the Book of the Dead, there is constant mention made
of the "mysterious beings whose names, whose ceremonials
are not known," which thirst for blood, which bring death,
which go about as devouring flame, as well as of others
which do good. At all times this element existed in
Egypt; but precisely at this time, in the reign of Psamtik,
Brugsch<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> declares that new force was given to it, and on
the monuments there appear, along with the "great gods,"
monstrous forms of demons and genii. In fact the higher
religion had become pantheistic, and consequently less
rigidly moral. Magic had been taken up into it for the
life beyond the grave, and became the only resource of
the people in this life. Fear, therefore, necessarily became
the ruling religious motive, and instead of growing toward
love of God, men in Egypt at this time were turning more
decisively than ever away from it.</p>

<p>Of the Assyrian religion and its influence it is also
difficult to speak in this connection, for notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the amount of translation that has been done, not much
has come to light in regard to the personal religion of
the Assyrians. On the whole it seems to be established
that in its main features the religion of both Babylon and
Assyria remained what the non-Semitic inhabitants of
Akkad had made it. Originally it had consisted entirely
of a spirit and demon worship not one whit more
advanced than the religion of the South Sea islanders
to-day. As such it was in the main a religion of fear.
Though some spirits were good, the bulk were evil, and
all were capricious. Men were consequently all their
lifetime subject to bondage, and love as a religious
emotion was impossible. When the Semites came at a
later time into the country their star-worship was amalgamated
with this mere Shamanism of the Akkadians.
In the new faith thus evolved the great gods of the
Semites were arranged in a hierarchy, and the spirits,
both good and evil, were subordinated to them. But
even the great gods remain within the sphere of nature,
and have in full measure the defects and limitations of
nature-gods everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> They are not entirely beneficent
powers, nor are they even moral beings. Some have
special delight in blood and destruction, while the cruel
Semitic child-sacrifice was practised in honour of others.
Again, their displeasure has no necessary or even general
connection with sin. Their wrath is generally the outcome
of mere arbitrary whim. Indeed it may be doubted
whether the conception of sin or of moral guilt ever had
a secure footing in this religion. It certainly had none in
the terror-struck hymn to the seven evil spirits who are
described thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Seven (are) they, seven (are) they.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Male they (are) not, female they (are) not;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Moreover the deep is their pathway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wife they have not, child is not born to them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Law (and) order they know not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prayer and supplication hear they not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wicked (are) they, wicked (are) they."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is here an accent of genuine terror, which
involved not love, but hatred. Even in what Sayce calls
a "Penitential Psalm," and which he compares to the
Biblical Psalms, there is nothing of the gratitude to God
as a deliverer from sin which in Israel was the chief
factor in producing the response to Yahweh's demand for
the love of man. Morally, it contains nothing higher
than is contained in the hymn of the spirits. The
transgressions which are so pathetically lamented, and
from the punishment of which deliverance is so earnestly
sought, are purely ceremonial and involuntary. The
author of the prayer conceives that he has to do with a
god whose wrath is a capricious thing, coming upon men
they know not why. So conceived God cannot be loved.
It is entirely in accord with this that in the great flood
epic no reason is given for the destruction of mankind
save the caprice of Bel.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The few expressions quoted
by Sayce from a hymn to the sun-god&mdash;such as this,
"Merciful God, that liftest up the fallen, that supportest
the weak.... Like a wife, thou submittest thyself,
cheerful and kindly.... Men far and wide bow before
thee and rejoice"&mdash;cannot avail to subvert a conclusion so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
firmly fixed. These are simply the ordinary expressions
which the mere physical pleasure of the sunlight brings to
the lips of sun-worshippers of all ages and of all climes.
At best they could only be taken as germs out of which
a loving relation between God and man might have been
developed. But though they were ancient they never
were developed. At the end as at the beginning the
Assyrio-Babylonian religion moves on so low a level,
even in its more innocent aspects, that a development like
that in Deuteronomy is absolutely impossible. In its worse
aspects Assyrian religion was unspeakable. The worship
of Ishtar at Nineveh outdid everything known in the
ancient world for lust and cruelty.</p>

<p>On this side too, therefore, we find no parallel to
Israel's new outgrowth of higher religion. Comparison
only makes it stand out more boldly in its splendid
originality; and we are left with the fruitful question,
"What was the root of the astonishing difference between
Yahweh and every other god whom Israel had heard of?"
Precisely at this time and under the same circumstances,
the ethnic religions around Israel were developing away
from any higher elements they had contained, and were
thereby, as we know now, hastening to extinction.
Under the inspired prophetic influence, Israel's religion
turned the loss of the nation into gain; it rose by the
darkness of national misfortune into a nobler phase than
any it had previously known.</p>

<p>But perhaps the crowning merit of this demand for
love of God is the emphasis it lays upon personality in
both God and man, and the high level at which it conceives
their mutual relations. From the first, of course,
the personal element was always very strongly present
in the Israelite conception of God. Indeed personality
was the dominating idea among all the smaller nations
which surrounded Israel. The national god was conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of mainly as a greater and more powerful man, full
of the energetic self-assertion without which it would be
impossible for any man to reign over an Eastern community.
The Moabite stone shows this, for in it Chemosh
is as sharply defined a person as Mesha himself. The
Canaanite gods, therefore, might be wanting in moral
character; their existence was doubtless thought of in a
limited and wholly carnal manner; but there never was,
apparently, the least tendency to obscure the sharp lines
of their individuality. In Israel, <i>a fortiori</i>, such a tendency
did not exist; and that a writer of Matthew Arnold's ability
should have persuaded himself, and tried to persuade
others, that under the name of Yahweh Israel understood
anything so vague as his "stream of tendency which
makes for righteousness," is only another instance of the
extraordinarily blinding effects of a preconceived idea.
So far from Yahweh being conceived in that manner, it
would be much easier to prove that, whatever aberrations
in the direction of making God merely "a non-natural
man" may be charged upon Christianity, they
have been founded almost exclusively upon Old Testament
examples and Old Testament texts. If there was defect
in the Old Testament conception of God, it was, and
could not but be, in the direction of drawing Him down
too much into the limits of human personality.</p>

<p>But though the gods were always thought of by the
Canaanites as personal, their character was not conceived
as morally high. Moral character in Chemosh, Moloch,
or Baal was not of much importance, and their relations
with their peoples were never conditioned by moral
conduct. How deeply ingrained this view was in
Palestine is seen in the persistency with which even
Yahweh's relation to His people was viewed in this light.
Only the continual outcry of the prophets against it prevented
this idea becoming permanently dominant even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in Israel. Nay, it often deceived would-be prophets.
Clinging to the idea of the national God, and forgetting
altogether the ethical character of Yahweh, without, perhaps,
conscious insincerity, they prophesied peace to the
wicked, and so came to swell the ranks of the false
prophets. But from very early times another thought
was cherished by Israel's representative men in regard
to their relations with God. Yahweh was righteous,
and demanded righteousness in His people. Oblations
were vain if offered as a substitute for this. All the
prophets reach their greatest heights of sublimity in
preaching this ethically noble doctrine; and the love to
God which Deuteronomy demands is to be exhibited in
reverent obedience to moral law.</p>

<p>Moreover, that God should seek or even need the love
of man threw other light on the Old Testament religion.
If, without revelation, Israel had widened its mental horizon
so as to conceive Yahweh as Lord of the world, it may
be questioned whether it could have kept clear of the
gulf of pantheism. But by the manifestation of God in
their special history, the Israelites had been taught to rise
step by step to the higher levels, without losing their
conception of Yahweh as the living, personal, active friend
of their people. Moreover they had been early taught,
as we have seen, that the deep design of all that was
wrought for them was the good of all men. The love
of God was seen pressing forward to its glorious and
beneficent ends; and both by ascribing such far-reaching
plans to Yahweh, and by affirming His interest in
the fate of men, Israel's conception of the Divine
personality was raised alike in significance and power;
for anything more personal than love planning and
working towards the happiness of its objects cannot be
conceived. But the crown was set upon the Divine personality
by the claim to the love of man. This signified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
that to the Divine mind the individual man was not hid
from God by his nation, that he was not for Him a mere
specimen of a genus. Rather each man has to God a
special worth, a special character, which, impelled by His
free personal love, He seeks to draw to Himself. At
every step each man has near him "the great Companion,"
who desires to give Himself to him. Nay, more, it
implies that God seeks and needs an answering love;
so that Browning's daring declaration, put into the mouth
of God when the song of the boy Theocrite is no more
heard, "I miss My little human praise," is simple truth.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>But if the demand illustrates and illuminates the personality
of God, it throws out in a still more decisive
manner the personality of man. In a rough sense, of
course, there never could have been any doubt of that.
But children have to grow into full self-determining personality,
and savages never attain it. Both are at the
mercy of caprice, or of the needs of the moment, to which
they answer so helplessly that in general no consistent
course of conduct can be expected of them. That can be
secured only by rigorous self-determination. But the
power of self-determination does not come at once, nor
is acquired without strenuous and continued effort; it is,
in fact, a power which in any full measure is possessed
only by the civilised man. Now the Israelites were not
highly civilised when they left Egypt. They were still
at the stage when the tribe overshadowed and absorbed
the individual, as it does to-day among the South Sea
islanders. The progress of the prophetic thought towards
the demand for personal love has already been
traced. Here we must trace the steps by which the
personal element in each individual was strengthened in
Israel, till it was fit to respond to the Divine demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The high calling of the people reacted on the individual
Israelites. They saw that in many respects the nations
around them were inferior to them. Much that was
tolerated or even respected among them was an abomination
to Israel; and every Israelite felt that the honour of
his people must not be dragged in the dust by him, as it
would be if he permitted himself to sink to the heathen
level. Further, the laws regarding even ceremonial
holiness which in germ certainly, and probably in considerable
extension also, existed from the earliest time,
made him feel that the sanctity of the nation depended
upon the care and scrupulosity of the individual. And
then there were the individual spiritual needs, which could
not be suppressed and would not be denied. Though
one sees so little explicit provision for restoration of
individual character in early Yahwism, yet in the course
of time&mdash;who can doubt it?&mdash;the personal religious needs
of so many individual men would necessarily frame for
themselves some outlet. Building upon the analogy of
the relation established between Yahweh and Israel, they
would hope for the satisfaction of their individual needs
through the infinite mercy of God. The Psalms, such
of them as can fairly be placed in the pre-Deuteronomic
time, bear witness to this; and those written after that
time show a hopefulness, and a faith in the reality of
individual communion with God which show that such
communion was not then a new discovery.</p>

<p>In all these ways the religious life of the individual
was being cultivated and strengthened; but this demand
made in Deuteronomy lifts that indirect refreshment of
soul, for which the cultus and the covenants made no
special provision, into a recognised position, nay, into
the central position in Israelite religion. The word,
"Thou shalt love Yahweh thy God," confirmed and
justified all these persistent efforts after individual life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in God, and brought them out into the large place which
belongs to aspirations that have at last been authorised.
By a touch, the inspired writer transformed the pious
hopes of those who had been the chosen among the
chosen people into certainties. Each man was henceforth
to have his own direct relation to God as well as the
nation; and the national hope, which had hitherto been
first, was now to depend for its realisation upon the
fulfilment of the special and private hope. Thus the old
relation was entirely reversed by Deuteronomy. Instead
of the individual holding "definite place in regard to
Yahweh only through his citizenship," now the nation
has its place and its future secured only by the personal
love of each citizen to God. For that is obviously what
the demand here made really means. Again and again
the inspired writer returns to it; and his persistent endeavour
is to connect all else that his book contains&mdash;warning,
exhortation, legislation&mdash;with this as the foundation
and starting-point. Here, as elsewhere, we can trace
the roots of the new covenant which Jeremiah and Ezekiel
saw afar off and rejoiced at, and which our blessed Lord
has realised for us. The individual religious life is for
the first time fully recognised for what ever since it has
been seen to be, the first condition of any attempt to
realise the kingdom of God in the life of a nation.</p>

<p>And not only thus does our text emphasise individuality.
Love with all the heart, and all the mind, and all the soul
is possible only to a fully developed personality; for, as
Rothe says, "We love only in the measure in which
personality is developed in us. Even God can love only in
so far as He is personal."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Or, as Julius Muller says in his
<cite>Doctrine of Sin</cite>, "The association of personal beings in
love, while it involves the most perfect distinction of the I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and Thou, proves itself to be the highest form of unity."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Unless other counteracting circumstances come in, therefore,
the more highly developed individuality is, the more
entirely human beings are determined from within, the
more entirely will union among men depend upon free and
deliberate choice, and the more perfect will it be. In
being called to love God men are dealt with as those who
have attained to complete self-determination, who have
come to completed manhood in the moral life. For all
that could mix love with alloy, mere sensuous sympathy,
and the insistent appeal of that which is materially present,
are wanting here. Here nothing is involved but the free
outgoing of the heart to that which is best and highest;
nothing but loyalty to that vision of Good which, amid all
the ruin sin has wrought in human nature, dominates us
so that "we needs must love the highest when we see
it." The very demand is a promise and a prophecy of
completed moral and religious liberty to the individual
soul. It rests upon the assurance that men have at last
been trained to walk alone, that the support of social
life and external ordinances has become less necessary
than it was, and that one day a new and living way of
access to the Father will bring every soul into daily
intercourse with the source of all spiritual life.</p>

<p>But this demand, in affirming personality of so high a
kind, also re-created duty. Under the national dispensation
the individual man was a <em>servant</em>. To a large
extent he knew not what his Lord did, and he ruled his
life by the commands he received without understanding,
or perhaps caring to understand, their ultimate ground
and aim. Much too of what he thus laid upon himself
was mere ancient custom, which had been a protection
to national and moral life in early days, but which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
survived, or was on the point of surviving, its usefulness.
Now, however, that man was called upon to love God with
all his heart and mind and soul, the step was taken which
was to end in his becoming the consciously free <em>son</em> of
God. For to love in this fashion means, on the one hand,
a willingness to enter into communion with God and to
seek that communion; and on the other it implies a
throwing open of the soul to receive the love which God
so persistently has pressed upon men. In such a relation
slavery, blind or constrained obedience, disappears, and
the motives of right action become the purest and most
powerful that man can know.</p>

<p>In the first place, selfishness dies out. Those to whom
God has given Himself have no more to seek. They
have reached the dwelling "of peace imperturbable," and
know that they are secure. Nothing that they do can
win more for them; and they do those things that please
God with the free, uncalculating, ungrudging forgetfulness
of self, which distinguishes those fortunate children
who have grown up into a perfect filial love. Of
course it was only the elect in Israel who in any great
degree realised this ideal. But even those who neglected
it had for a moment been illuminated by it; and the
record of it remained to kindle the nobler hearts of every
generation. Even the legalism of later days could not
obscure it. In the case of many it bore up and transfigured
the dry details of Judaism, so that even amid
such surroundings the souls of men were kept alive. The
later Psalms prove this beyond dispute, and the advanced
view which brings the bulk of the Psalter down to the
post-exilic period only emphasises the more this aspect of
pre-Christian Judaism. In Christianity of course the ideal
was made infinitely more accessible: and it received in the
Pauline doctrine, the Evangelical doctrine, of Justification
by Faith a form, which more than any other human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
teaching has made unselfish devotion to God a common
aim. It would hardly be too much to say that those philosophical
and religious systems which have preached the
unworthiness of looking for a reward of well-doing, which
have striven to set up the doing of good for its own sake
as the only morality worthy of the name, have failed, just
because they would not begin with the love of God. To
Christianity, especially to Evangelical Christianity, they
have assumed to speak from above downwards; but it
alone has the secret they strove in vain to learn. Men
justified by faith have peace with God, and do good with
passionate fervour without hope or possibility of further
reward, just because of their love and gratitude to God,
who is the source of all good. This plan has succeeded,
and no other has; for to teach men on any other terms to
disregard reward is simply to ask them to breathe in a
vacuum.</p>

<p>In the second place, those who rose to the height of this
calling had duty not only deepened but extended. It
was natural that they should not seek to throw off the
obligations of worship and morality as they had been
handed down by their ancestors. Only an authoritative
voice which they were separated from by centuries could
say, "It hath been said by them of old time, ... but <em>I</em> say
unto you"; and men would be disposed rather to fulfil
old obligations with new zeal, while they added to
them the new duties which their widened horizon had
brought into view. It is true that in course of time the
Pharisaic spirit laid hold of the Jews, and that by it
they were led back into a slavery which quite surpassed
the half-conscious bondage of their earlier time. It is
one of the mysteries of human nature that it is only the
few who can live for any time at a high level, and hold
the balance between extremes. The many cannot choose
but follow those few; and the dumb, half-reluctant, half-fascinated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
way in which they are drawn after them is a
most pathetic thing to see. But too often they avenge
themselves for the pressure put upon them, by taking
up the teaching they receive in a perverted or mutilated
form, dropping unawares the very soul of it, and suiting
it to the average man. When that is done the bread
from heaven becomes a stone; the message of liberty
is turned into a summons to the prison house; and the
darkness becomes of that opaque sort which is found only
where the light within men is darkness. That tragedy
was enacted in Judaism as rarely elsewhere. The free
service of sons was exchanged for the timorous, anxious
scrupulosity of the formalist. How could men love a
God whom they pictured as inexorable in claiming the
mint and cummin of ceremonial worship, and as making
life a burden for all who had a conscience? They could
not, and they did not. Most substituted a merely
formal compliance with the externalities of worship for the
love to God and man which was the presupposition of
the true Israelite's life, and the mass of the nation fell
away from true faith. Strangely enough, therefore, the
strength of men's love for God, and of their belief in His
love, gave an impulse to the legalistic Pharisaism which
our Lord denounced as the acme of loveless irreligion.</p>

<p>But it was not so perverted in all. There always
was an Israel within Israel that refused to let go the
truths they had learned, and kept up the succession of
men inspired by the free spirit of God. Even among the
Pharisees there were such&mdash;witness St. Paul&mdash;men who,
though they were entangled in the formalism of their time,
found it at last a pedagogue to bring them unto Christ.
We must believe therefore that at the beginning the
attainment marked by the demands of Deuteronomy and
the Law of Holiness existed and was carried over into
the daily life. As the national limits of religion were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
broken down, the word "neighbour" received an ever
wider definition in Israel. At first only a man's fellow-tribesman
or fellow-countryman was included; then
the stranger; later, as in Jonah's picture of the conduct
of the sailors, it was hinted that even among the
heathen brethren might be found. Finally, in our Lord's
parable of the Good Samaritan the last barrier was broken
down. But it needed all St. Paul's lifework, and the first
and most desperate inner conflict Christianity had to live
through, to initiate men into anything like the full
meaning of what Christ had taught. Then it was seen
that as there was but one Father in heaven, so there was
but one family on earth. Then too, though the merely
ceremonial duties by which the Jew had been bound
ceased to be binding on Christians, the sphere for the
practice of moral duty was immensely widened. Indeed,
had it not been for the free, joyous spirit with which
they were inspired by Christ, they must have shrunk
from the immensity of their obligation. For not only
were men's neighbours infinitely more numerous now,
but their relations with them became vastly more complicated.
To meet all possible cases that might arise
in the great and elaborate civilisations Christianity had
to face and save, our Lord deepened the meaning of the
commandments; and so far from Christians being free from
the obligation to law, immeasurably more was demanded
of them. To them first was the full sweep of moral
obligation revealed, for they first had reached the full
moral stature of men in Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><i>EDUCATION&mdash;MOSAIC VIEW</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> vi. 6-25</h4>


<p>Those great verses, Deut. vi. 4, 5, form the central
truth of the book. Everything else in it proceeds
from and is informed by them, and they are dwelt
upon and enforced with a clear perception of their
radical importance. There is something of the joy of
discovery in the way in which the unity of Yahweh and
exclusive love to Him are insisted upon, not only in
verses 6-25 of this chapter, but in xi. 13-20. The same
strongly worded demand to lay to heart Yahweh's command
to love Him and Him only, and to teach it
strenuously to their children&mdash;to make it "a sign upon
their hand," and "as a frontlet between their eyes"&mdash;is
found in both passages. It is worthy of remark also that
nearly the same words are found in Exod. xiii. 9, 16.
Presumably on account of this, some have ascribed that
section of Exodus to the author of Deuteronomy. But
both Dillmann and Driver ascribe these passages to
J and E, and with good reason. Indeed, apart from the
purely literary grounds for thinking that these formulas
were first used by the earlier writers and were copied
by the author of Deuteronomy, another line of argument
points in the same direction. In Exodus the thing to be
remembered and taught to the children was the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and origin of the Passover and the consecration of the
firstborn, <i>i.e.</i> the meaning and origin of some of their
ritual institutions. Here in Deuteronomy, on the contrary,
that which is to be written on the heart and
taught to the children is moral and spiritual truth about
God, and love to God. Now the probable explanation
of this likeness and difference is, not that the author of
Deuteronomy, after using this insistive phrase only of
high spiritual truths in his own book, inserted it in
Exodus with regard to mere institutions of the cultus;
rather, the writers of Exodus had used it of that which
was important in their day, and the Deuteronomist borrowed
it from them to emphasise his own most cherished
revelation. In the earlier stages of a religious movement,
the establishment of institutions which shall
embody and perpetuate religious truth, is one of the first
necessities. It has become a commonplace of Christian
defence, for example, that Baptism and the Lord's Supper
were made the most successful vehicles for conveying
fundamental Christian truth, and that the celebration of
these two rites from the first days even until now is
one of the most convincing proofs of the continuity of
Christianity. Naturally, therefore, the establishment of
the Passover was specially marked out as the <em>palladium</em>
of Israelite religion in the earlier days. But in the
time after Isaiah, when Deuteronomy was written, the
institutions needed no longer such insistence. They had
indeed become so important to the people that the mere
observance of them threatened to become a substitute for
religious and even moral feeling. The Deuteronomist's
great message was, consequently, a reiteration of the
prophetic truths as to the supremacy of the spiritual; and
for the object of the warm exhortation of the earlier
writings he substituted the proclamation of Yahweh's
oneness, and of His demand for His people's love. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
seems a reasonable and probable explanation of the facts
as we find them. If true, it is a proof that the need
of ritual institutions, and the danger of unduly exalting
them, was not peculiar to post-exilic times. In principle
the temptation was always present; and as living faith
rose and fell it came into operation, or was held in
abeyance, throughout the whole of Israel's history. Hence
the mention of this kind of formalism or the denunciation
of it must be very cautiously used as a criterion
by which to date any Scriptural writings.</p>

<p>It is therefore with a full consciousness of its
fundamental importance that the author of Deuteronomy
follows the great passage chapter vi. 4, 5, with this
solemn and inspiring exhortation. It is from no mere
itch for religious improvement of the occasion that he
presses home his message thus. Nor is it love for the
mere repetition of an ancient formula of exhortation that
dictates its use. He knew and understood the work of
Moses, and felt that the moulding power in Israel's life
as a nation, the unifying element in it, had been the
religion of Yahweh. Whatever else may have been
called in question, it has never been doubted that the salt
which kept the political and social life of the people
from rotting through many centuries was the always
advancing knowledge of God. At each great crisis of
Israel's history the religion of Yahweh had met the
demands for direction, for inspiration, for uplifting which
were made upon it. With Protean versatility it had
adapted itself to every new condition. In all circumstances
it had provided a lamp for the feet and a light
for the path of the faithful; and in meeting the needs of
generation after generation it had revealed elements of
strength and consolation which, without the commentary
of experience, could never have been brought out. Now
the author of Deuteronomy felt that in these short sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the high-water mark of Israelite religion so far had been
reached, and that in renewing the work of Moses, and
adapting it to his own time, the principles here enunciated
must be the main burden of his message. Further progress
depended, he obviously felt, upon the absorption and
assimilation of these truths by his people, and he felt he
must provide for the perpetuation of them in that better
time he was preparing for. This he did by providing for
the religious education of the young. Whatever else
Israel had gained it had been careful to hand on from
generation to generation. The land flowing with milk
and honey was still in the possession of the descendants
of the first conquerors. The literature, the science, the
wisdom that the fathers had gathered, had been carefully
passed down to the children; and a precious deposit of
enriching experience in the form of history had reached
to the elect even among the common people, as the example
of Amos shows. But the most valuable heritage
of Israel was that continually growing deposit of religious
truth which had been the life-blood of its master spirits.
From generation to generation the noblest men in the
nation, those most sensitive to the touch of the Divine, had
been casting soundings into the great deep of the hidden
purposes of God. With sore travail of both mind and
spirit, they had found solutions of the great problems
which no living soul can escape. These were no doubt
more or less partial, but they were sufficient for their day,
and were always in the line of the final answer. As the
sum of experience widened, the scope of the solutions
widened also, and in the course of Providence these issued
in a conception of God which elsewhere was never approached.
This of all national treasures was the most
priceless, and to preserve and hand on this was simply
to keep the national soul alive. Compared with this,
every other heritage from the past was as nothing; and so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with a simple directness which must amaze the legislators
of modern states, the inspired lawgiver arranged for a
religious education.</p>

<p>To him, as to all ancient lawgivers, a commonwealth
without religion was simply inconceivable, and the hampering,
confusing, and confused difficulties of to-day lay far
beyond his horizon. Parents must take over this great
heritage and lay it deeply to heart. They must then
make it the subject of their common talk. They must
write the profound words which summed it up upon the
doorposts of their houses. They must let it fill their
minds at their down-sitting and their uprising, and while
they walked by the way. Further, as the crown of their
work, they were to teach it diligently to their children,
already accustomed by their parents' continual interest
to regard this as the worthiest object of human thought.
But though the parents were to be the chief instructors of
children in religion, the State or the community was also
to do its part. As the private citizen was to write, "Hear,
O Israel: Yahweh our God is one Yahweh; and thou
shalt love Yahweh thy God with all thine heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy might," on the posts of his
door, so the representatives of the community were to
write them upon the town or village gates. In those
early days schools were unknown, as State-regulated
schools are still unknown in all purely Eastern countries.
Consequently there was no sphere for the State in
the direct religious teaching of the young. But so far
as it could act, the State was to act. It was to commit
itself to the religious principles that underlay the life of
the people, and to proclaim them with the utmost publicity.
It was to secure that none should be ignorant of them, so
far as proclamation by writing in the most public place
could secure knowledge, for on this the very existence of
the State depended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>But the religious instruction was not to be limited to
the reiteration of these great sentences; in that case they
would have become a mere form of words. In the last
verses of the chapter, vv. 20-25, we find a model of the kind
of explanatory comment which was to be given in addition:
"When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
judgments, which Yahweh our God hath commanded
you? then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were
Pharaoh's bondmen in the land of Egypt; and Yahweh
brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand," and so on.
That means that the <em>history</em> of Yahweh's dealings with
His people was to be taught, to show the reasonableness
of the Divine commands, to exhibit the love-compelling
character of God. And this was entirely in accord with
the Biblical conception of God. Neither here nor elsewhere
in the Old Testament are there any abstract
definitions of His character, His spirituality, His
omnipresence, or His omnipotence. Nor is there anywhere
any argument to prove His existence. All that
is postulated, presupposed, as that which all men believe,
except those who have wilfully perverted themselves.
But the existence of God with all these great and
necessary attributes is undoubtedly implied in what is
narrated of Yahweh's dealings with His people. As we
have seen, too, the very name of Yahweh implies that
His nature should not be limited by any definition. He
was what He would prove Himself to be, and throughout
the Old Testament the <i>gesta Dei</i> through and for the
Israelites, and the prophetic promises made in Yahweh's
name, represented all that was known of God. This
gave a peculiarly healthy and robust tone to Old Testament
piety. The subjective, introspective element which
in modern times is so apt to take the upper hand, was
kept in due subordination by making history the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
nourishment of religious thought. In constant contact
with external fact, Israelite piety was simple, sincere, and
practical; and men's thoughts being turned away from
themselves to the Divine action in the world, they were
less touched by the disease of self-consciousness than
modern believers in God. In every sphere of human
life, too, they looked for God, and traced the working
of His hand. The later distinction between the sacred
and secular parts of life, which has been often pushed to
disastrous extremes, was to them unknown. For these
among many other reasons, the Old Testament must
always remain of vital importance to the Church of God.
It can fall into neglect only when the religious life is
becoming unhealthy and one-sided.</p>

<p>Further, its qualities especially fit it for use in the
education of children. In many respects a child's mind
resembles the mind of a primitive people. It has the
same love of concrete examples, the same incapacity to
appreciate abstract ideas, and it has the same susceptibility
to such reasoning as this: God has been very loving and
gracious to men, especially to our forefathers, and we
are therefore bound to love Him and to obey Him with
reverence and fear. To the children of a primitive people
such teaching would therefore be doubly suitable; but the
Deuteronomist's anxiety in regard to it has been justified
by its results in times no longer primitive. Through ages
of persecution and oppression, often amid a social environment
of the worst sort, there has been little or no wavering
in the fundamental points of Jewish faith. Scattered and
peeled, slaughtered and decimated, as they have been
through blood-stained centuries, this nation have held fast
to their religion. Not even the fact that, through their
refusal to accept their Messiah when He came, the most
tender, the most expansive, the most highly spiritual
elements of the Old Testament religion have escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
them, has been able to neutralise the benefit of the truth
they have so tenaciously held. Of non-Christian nations
they stand by far the highest; and among the orthodox
Jews who still keep firm to the national traditions, and
teach the ancient Scriptures diligently to their children,
there is often seen a piety and a confidence in God, a
submission and a hopefulness which put to shame many
who profess to have hope in Christ. Even in our day,
when agnosticism and denial of the supernatural is eating
into Judaism more than into almost any other creed,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
a book like Friedl√§nder's <cite>The Jewish Religion</cite> gives us
a very favourable idea of the spirit and teachings of
orthodox Judaism. And its main stay is, and always
has been, the religious training of the young. "In
obedience to the precept 'Thou shalt speak of them,'
<i>i.e.</i> of 'the words which I command thee this day,'"says
Friedl√§nder, "'when thou liest down and when thou risest
up,' three sections of the law are read daily, in the
morning and in the evening, viz. (1) Deut. vi. 4-9, beginning
'Hear'; (2) Deut. xi. 13-21, beginning 'And it
shall be if ye diligently hearken'; (3) Numb. xv. 37-41,
beginning 'And the Lord said.' The first section teaches
the unity of God, and our duty to love this one God with
all our heart, to make His word the subject of our
constant meditation and to instil it into the heart of
the young. The second section contains the lesson of
reward and punishment, that our success depends on our
obedience to the will of God. This important truth must
constantly be kept before our eyes, and before the eyes
of our children. The third section contains the commandments
of Tsitsith, the object of which is to remind us of
God's precepts." To-day, therefore, as so many centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ago, these great words are uttered daily in the ears of all
pious Jews, and they are as potent to keep them steady
to their faith now as they were then. For in most cases
where a drift towards the fashionable agnosticism of the
day or to atheistic materialism is observable among Jews,
it will be found to have been preceded either by neglect or
formalism in regard to this fundamental matter. Briefly,
without this teaching they cease to be Jews; with it
they remain steadfast as a rock. Uprooted as they are
from their country, their national coherence endures and
seems likely to endure till their set time has come. So
triumphantly has the enforcement of religious education
vindicated itself in the case of God's ancient people.</p>

<p>In the remaining verses of the chapter, vv. 10-19, we
have a warning against neglect and forgetfulness of their
God, and an indication of the circumstances under which
it would be most difficult to remain true to Him. These
are uttered entirely from the Mosaic standpoint, and are
among the passages which it is most difficult to reconcile
with the later authorship; for there would appear to be no
motive for the later writer to go back upon the exceptional
circumstances of the early days in Canaan. His object
must have been to warn and guide and instruct the people
of <em>his</em> time in the face of their difficulties and temptations,
to adapt Mosaic legislation and Mosaic teaching to the
needs of his own day. Now on any supposition he must
have written when all conquest on Israel's part had long
ceased. It is most probable too that in his day the
prosperity of his people was on the wane. They were
not looking forward to a time of special temptation from
riches; rather they were dreading expatriation and decay.
Consequently this reference to the ease with which they
became rich by occupying the cities and villages and farms
of those they had conquered is quite out of place, unless
we are to regard the author as a skilled and artistic writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
who deliberately set himself to reproduce in all respects
the mind and thoughts of a man of an earlier day, as
Thackeray, for instance, does in his <cite>Henry Esmond</cite>.
But that is not credible; and the explanation is that given
in Chapter I., that the addresses here attributed to Moses
are free reproductions of earlier traditions or narratives
concerning what Moses actually said. If we know anything
about Moses at all, it is in the highest degree
probable that he left his people some parting charge. He
longed to pass the Jordan with them. He could not fail
to see that an immense revolution in their habits and
manner of life was certain to occur when they entered the
promised land. That must have appeared to him fraught
with varied dangers, and words of warning and instructions
would rush even unbidden to his lips.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, at any rate, that this passage
is true to human nature in regarding the sudden acquirement
of great and goodly cities which they did not build,
and houses full of good things which they filled not, and
cisterns hewn out which they did not hew, vineyards and
olive trees which they did not plant, as a great temptation
to forgetfulness of God. At all times prosperity,
especially if it come suddenly, and without being won by
previous toil and self-denial, has tended to deteriorate
character. When men have no changes or vicissitudes,
then they fear not God. It is for help in trouble when
the help of man is vain, or for a deliverance in danger,
that average men most readily turn to God. But when
they feel fairly safe, when they have raised themselves,
as they think, "beyond all storms of chance," when they
have built up between themselves and poverty or failure
a wall of wealth and power, then the impulse that drives
them upward ceases to act. It becomes strangely pleasant,
and it seems safe, to get rid of the strain of living
at the highest attainable level, and with a sigh of relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
men stretch themselves out to rest and to enjoy. These
are the average men; but there are some in every age, the
elect, who have had the love of God shed abroad in their
hearts, who have had such real and intimate communion
with God that separation from Him would turn all other
joys into mockery. They cannot yield to this temptation
as most do, and in the midst of wealth and comfort keep
alive their aspirations. In Israel these two classes
existed; and to the former, <i>i.e.</i> to the great bulk of both
rulers and people, the stimulus administered by the
conquest to the material side of their nature must have
been potent indeed.</p>

<p>It is here implied that the Israelite people when they
entered Canaan had some moral education to lose.
Whether that could be so is the question asked by
many critics, and their answer is an emphatic No. They
were, say they, a rude, desert people, without settled
habits of life, without knowledge of agriculture, and
possessed of a religion which in all outward respects was
scarcely, if at all, higher than that of the surrounding
nations. What happened to them in Canaan, therefore,
was not a lapse, but a rise. They advanced from being
a wandering pastoral people to become settled agriculturists.
They gained knowledge of the arts of life by
their contact with the Canaanites, and they lost little or
nothing in religion; for they were themselves only image-worshippers
and looked upon Yahweh as on a level
with the Canaanite Baals. But if the Decalogue belongs,
in any form, to that early time, and if the character of
Moses be in any degree historical, then, of course, this
mode of view is false. Then Israel worshipped a spiritual
God, who was the guardian of morals; and there was
in the mind of their leader and legislator a light which
illuminated every sphere of life, both private and national.
Consequently there could be a falling away from a higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
level of religious life, as the Scriptures consistently say
there was. Without perhaps having understood and
made their own the fundamental truths of Yahwism,
the people had had their whole social and political life
remodelled in accordance with its principles. They had,
moreover, had time to learn something of its inner
meaning, and in forty years we may well believe that
the more spiritually minded among them had become
imbued with the higher religious spirit. Add to that
the union, the movement, the excitement of a successful
advance, crowned by conquest, and we have all the
elements of a revived religious and national life among
Eastern people.</p>

<p>Similar causes have produced precisely similar effects
since. In important respects the origin of Mohammedanism
repeats the same story. A semi-nomadic people, divided
into clans and tribes, related by blood but never united,
were unified by a great religious idea vastly in advance of
any they had hitherto known. The religious reformer
who proclaimed this truth, and those who belonged to the
inner circle of his friends and counsellors, were turned
from many evils, and exhibited a moral force and
enthusiasm corresponding, in some degree at least, to the
sublimity of the religious doctrine they had embraced.
The masses, on their part, received and submitted to a
revised and improved scheme of social life. Then they
moved forward to conquest, and in their first days not only
trampled down opposition, but deserved to do so, for in
most respects they were superior to the ignorant and
degraded Christians they overthrew. They came out of
the desert, and were at first soldiers only. But in a
generation or two they largely settled to purely agricultural
life, as landowners for whom the native population
laboured; and they gained in knowledge of the arts of life
from the more civilised peoples they conquered. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
religious and moral character imitations of the conquered
peoples involved, for the conquerors, a loss. And soon
they did lose. The violence accompanying successful war
produced arrogance and injustice; the immense wealth
thrown into their hands so suddenly gave rise to luxury
and greed. Within twenty-five years from the flight of
Mohammed from Mecca, relaxation of manners manifested
itself. Sensuality and drunkenness were rife; with Ali's
death the Caliphate passed into the hands of Muawia, the
leader of the still half-heathen part of the Koreish; and
the secular indifferent portion of Mohammed's followers
ruled in Islam.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Allowing all that can be allowed for exceptional
influences in Israel, we may well believe that the circumstances
of the first invaders were such as would strain
the influence of the higher religion upon the nation. And
after the conquest and settlement the strain would
necessarily be greater still. Whatever drawbacks warfare
may have, it at least keeps men active and hardy, but the
rest of a conqueror after warfare is a temptation to luxury
and corruption which has been very rarely resisted. Even
to-day, when men enter upon new and vacant lands, and
that without war and under Christian influences, the plenty
which the first immigrants soon gather about them proves
adverse to higher thought. In America in its earlier
days, and in new American territories and Australia now,
our civilisation at that stage always takes a materialistic
turn. Every man may hope to become rich, the resources
of the country are so great and those who are to share
them are so few. In order to develop them, all concerned
must give their time and thoughts to the work, and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
become absorbed in it. The result is that, though the
religious instinct asserts itself in sufficient strength to
lead to the building of churches and schools, and men
are too busy to be much influenced by theoretical unbelief,
yet the pulse of religion beats feebly and low. The
feeling spreads, under many disguises it is true, but still
it spreads, that a man's life does "consist in the abundance
of the things which he possesseth"; and the heroic
element of Christianity, the impulse to self-sacrifice, falls
into the background. The result is a social life respectable
enough, save that the social blots due to self-indulgence
are a good deal more conspicuous than they should be; a
very high average of general comfort, with its necessary
drawback of a self-satisfied and somewhat ignoble contentment;
and a religious life that prides itself mainly in
avoiding the falsehood of extremes. In such an atmosphere
true and living religion has great difficulty in
asserting itself. Each individual is drawn away from the
region of higher thought more powerfully than in the older
lands where ambitions are for most men less plausible;
and so the struggle to keep the soul sensitive to spiritual
influences is more hard. As for the national life, public
affairs in those circumstances tend to be ruled simply
by the standard of immediate expediency, and strenuousness
of principle or practice tends to be regarded as an
impossible ideal.</p>

<p>To all this Israel was exposed, and to more. There
are doubts as to the extent of their conquests when they
settled down; but there are none that when they did
so they still had heathen Canaanites among them.
Throughout almost the whole country the population was
mixed, and constant intercourse with the conquered
peoples was unavoidable. At first these were either Israel's
teachers in many of the arts of settled life, or they must
have carried on the work of agriculture for their Israelite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
lords. Moreover many of the sacred places of the land,
the sanctuaries which from time immemorial had been
resorted to for worship, were either taken over by the
Israelites or were left in Canaanite hands. In either
case they opened a way for malign influences upon the
purer faith. Gradually, too, the tribal feeling asserted
itself. The tribal heads regained the position they had
held before the domination of Moses and his successor,
just as the tribal heads of the Arabs asserted themselves
after the death of Mohammed and his immediate
successors, and plunged into fratricidal war with the
companions of their prophet. The only difference was
that, while the circumstances of the Arabs compelled them
to retain a supreme head, the circumstances of the
Israelites permitted them to fall back into the tribal isolation
from which they had emerged. The national life was
broken up, the religious life followed in the same path,
until, as the Book of Judges graphically says in narrating
how Micah set up an Ephod and Teraphim for himself
and made his son a priest, "every man did that which
was right in his own eyes." With a people so recently
won for a higher faith, there could not but follow a
recrudescence of heathen or semi-heathen beliefs and
practices.</p>

<p>To sum up, given a great truth revealed to one man,
which, though accepted by a nation, is only half understood
by the bulk of them, and given also a great national
deliverance and expansion brought about by the same
leader, you have there the elements of a great enthusiasm
with the seeds of its own decay within it. Such a nation,
especially if plied with external temptation, will fall back,
not into its first state certainly, but into a condition much
below its highest level, so soon as the leader and those
who had really comprehended the new truth are removed
to a distance or are dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of Mohammedanism this was instinctively
felt. We find the Governor of Bassorah writing thus
to Omar, the third Khalif: "Thou must strengthen my
hands with a company of the Companions of the Prophet,
for verily they are as salt in the midst of the people."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
The same thing is expressly asserted of Israel also by
the later editor in Josh. xxiv. 31: "And Israel served
the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the
elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work
of the Lord, that He had wrought for Israel." It would
almost seem as if Semitic peoples were specially liable to
such oscillations, if Palgrave's account of the people of
Nejed before the rise of the Wahabbis in the middle of
last century can be trusted. "Almost every trace of
Islam," he says,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> "had long since vanished from Nejed,
where the worship of the Djann, under the spreading
foliage of large trees, or in the cavernous recesses of
Djebel Toweyk, along with the invocation of the dead
and sacrifices at their tombs, was blended with remnants
of old Sab√¶an superstition. The Coran was unread,
the five daily prayers forgotten, and no one cared where
Mecca lay, east or west, north or south; tithes, ablutions,
and pilgrimages were things unheard of."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> If that
was the state of things in a country exposed to no
extraneous influences after a thousand years of Islam,
we may well believe that the state of Israel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
time of the Judges was a fall from a better state religiously
as well as politically. Looking to the future,
Moses might well foresee the danger; and looking back
the author of Deuteronomy would have reasons, many of
them now unknown, for knowing that what was feared
had occurred.</p>

<p>It is striking to see that both know but one security
against such lapses in the life of a nation, and that is
education. Nowadays we are inclined to ask if this was
not a delusion on their part. The boundless faith in
education as a moral, religious, and national restorative
which filled men's minds in the early part of this
century, has given place to disquieting questions as to
whether it can do anything so high. Many begin to
doubt whether it does more than restrain men from
the worst crimes, by pointing out their consequences.
And in the case of ordinary secular education that doubt
is only too well founded. But it was not mere secular
education the Old Testament relied on. Reading, writing,
and arithmetic, valuable as these are as gateways to
knowledge, were not in its view at all. What it was felt
necessary to do was to keep alive an ideal view of life;
and that was done by pouring into the young the history
of their people, with the best that their highest minds
had learned and thought of God. The demand is that
parents shall first of all give themselves up to the love of
God, without any reserve, and then that they shall teach
this diligently to their children as the substance of the
Divine demand upon <em>them</em>. Evidently by the words,
"Thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house,
and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest
down and when thou risest up," it is meant that the truth
about God and the thought of God should be a subject on
which conversation naturally turned, and to which it
gladly returned continually. Words about these things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
were to flow from a genuine delighted interest in them,
which made speech a necessity and a joy. Further,
parents were to meet the <em>na√Øve</em> and questioning curiosity
of their children as to the meaning of religious and moral
ordinances of their people, with grave and extended
teaching as to the work of God among them in the past.
They were to point out, vv. 21-25, all the grace of God,
and to show them that the statutes, which to young and
undisciplined minds might seem a heavy burden, were
really God's crowning mercy: they marked out the lines
upon which alone good could come to man: they were the
directions of a loving guide anxious to keep their feet
from paths of destruction, "for their good always." Such
education as this might prove adequate to overcome even
stronger temptations than those to which Israel was
exposed. For see what it means. It means that all the
garnered religious thought and emotion of past generations,
which the experiences of life and the felt presence of God
in them had borne in upon the deepest minds of Israel,
was to be made the bounding horizon for the opening
mind of every Israelite child. When the child looked
beyond the desires of its physical nature, it was to see
this great sight, this panorama of the grace of Yahweh.
To compensate for the restrictions which the Decalogue
puts upon the natural impulses, Yahweh was to be held
up to every child as an object of love, no desire after
which could be excessive. Love to Yahweh, drawn out
by what He had shown Himself to be, was to turn the
energies of the young soul outward, away from self, and
direct them to God, who works and is the sum of all good.
Obviously those upon whom such education had its
perfect work would never be fettered by the material
aspects of things. Their horizon could never be so
darkened that the twilight gods worshipped by the
Canaanites should seem to them more than dim and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
vanishing shadows. Every evil, incident to their circumstances
as conquerors, would fall innocuous at their feet.</p>

<p>The instrument put into the hands of Israel was,
viewed ideally, quite adequate for the work it had to do.
But the history of Israel shows that the effort to keep
Yahweh continually present to the mind of the people
failed; and the question arises, why did it fail? If, as we
have every reason to believe, the main tendencies of human
nature then were what they are now, the first cause of
failure would be with the parents. Many, probably the
most of them, would observe to do all that Moses commanded,
but they would do it without themselves keeping
alive their spiritual life. Wherever that was the case,
though the prayers should be scrupulously rehearsed,
though the religious talk should be increasing, though
the instruction about the past should be exact and regular,
the highest results of it all would cease to appear. The
best that would be done would be to keep alive knowledge
of what the fathers had told them. The worst would be
to render the child's mind so familiar with all aspects of
the truth, and with all the phases of religious emotion,
that throughout life this would always seem a region
already explored, and in which no water for the thirsty
soul had been found.</p>

<p>But in the children, too, there would be fatal hindrances.
One would almost expect, <i>a priori</i>, that when one generation
had won in trial and hardship and conquest a fund of
moral and spiritual wisdom, their children would be able
to take it to themselves, and would start from the point
their fathers had attained. But in experience that is not
found to be so. The fathers may have gained a sane and
strong manhood through the training and teaching of
Divine Providence, but their children do not start from
the level their fathers have gained. They begin with the
same passions, and evil tendencies, and illusions, as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
fathers began with, and against these they have to wage
continual war. Above all, each soul for itself must take
the great step by which it turns from evil to good. No
rise in the general level of life will ever enable men to
dispense with that. The will must determine itself morally
by a free choice, and the Divine grace must play its part,
before that union with God which is the heart of all
religion can be brought about. No mechanical keeping
up of good habits or fairer forms of social life can do
much at this crucial point; and so each generation finds
that there is no discharge in the war to which it is
committed. As in all wars, many fall; sometimes the
battle goes sorely against the kingdom of God, and the
majority fall. The strength and beauty of a whole generation
turns to the world and away from God, and the
labours and prayers of faithful men and women who have
taught them seem to be in vain.</p>

<p>The method of warding off evil by even high religious
education is consequently very imperfect and uncertain
in its action. Nevertheless this relative uncertainty is
bound up with the very nature of moral influence and
moral agency. Professor Huxley, in a famous passage
of one of his addresses, says that if any being would offer
to wind him up like a clock, so that he should always do
what is right, and think what is true, he would close with
the offer, and make no mourning about his moral freedom.
Probably this was only a vehement way of expressing
a desire for righteousness in deed, and truth in thought,
somewhat pathetic in such a man. But if we are to take
it literally, it is a singularly unwise declaration. The
longing which gives pathos to the professor's words would
on his hypothesis be a lunacy; for in the realm of
morals mechanical compulsion has no meaning. Even
God must give room to His creature, that he may exercise
the spiritual freedom with which he is endowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Even God, we may say without irreverence, must sometimes
fail in that which He seeks to accomplish, in the
field of moral life. Philosophically speaking, perhaps, this
statement cannot be defended. But it is not the Absolute
of Philosophy which can touch the hearts and draw the
love of men. It is the living, personal God, of whom
we gain our best working conception by boldly transferring
to Him the highest categories predicable of our
humanity. He is, doubtless, much more than we; but we
can only ascribe to Him our own best and highest. When
we have done that we have approached Him as near as
we can ever do. The Scriptural writers, therefore, have
no pedantic scruples in their speech about God. They
constantly represent Him as pleading with men, desiring
to influence them, and yet sometimes as being driven back
defeated by the obstinate sin of man. The Bible is full
of the failures of God in this sense; and God's greatest
failure, that which forms the burden and inspires the
pathos of the bulk of the Old Testament, is His failure
with His chosen people. They <em>would</em> not be saved, they
<em>would</em> not be faithful; and God had to accomplish His
work of planting the true and spiritual religion in the
world by means of a mere remnant of faithful men chosen
from a faithless multitude.</p>

<p>But though this plan failed miserably in one way, in
the way of gaining the bulk of the people, it succeeded
in another. As has just been said, <em>the</em> purpose of God
was in any case accomplished. But even apart from
that, the religious education that was given was of
immense importance. It raised the level of life for all;
like the Nile mud in the inundation, it fertilised the whole
field of this people's life. It kept an ideal, too, before
men, without which they would have fallen even lower
than they did. And it lay in the minds of even the
worst, ready to be changed into something higher; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
without previous intellectual acquaintance with the facts,
the deeper knowledge was impossible. Moreover the
ordinary civil morality of the people rested upon it.
Without their religion and the facts on which it was
based, the moral code had no hold upon them, and could
have none. That had grown up in one complex tangle
with religion; it had received its highest inspiration from
the conception of God handed down from the fathers; and
apart from that it would have fallen into an incoherent mass
of customs unable to justify or account for their existence.
In every community the same principle holds. Hence
whatever the theory of the relation of the State to religion
which may prevail, no State can, without much harm,
ignore the religion of the people. It may sometimes even
be wise and right for a government to introduce or to
encourage a higher religion at the expense of a lower.
But it can never be either wise or right to be inadvertent
of religion altogether. In accordance with this precept,
the rulers of Israel never were so. They not only
encouraged parents to be strenuous, as this passage
demands of them, but on more than one occasion they
made definite provision for the religious instruction of
the people. In a formal sense that grew into a habit
which even yet has not lost its hold; and hence, as we
have seen, the Jews have been kept true in an unexampled
manner to their racial and religious characteristics.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><i>THE BAN</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> vii.</h4>


<p>As in the previous chapter we have had the Mosaic
and Deuteronomic statement of the internal and
spiritual means of defending the Israelite character and
faith from the temptations which the conquest in Canaan
would bring with it, in this we have strenuous provision
made against the same evil by external means.
The mind first was to be fortified against the temptation
to fall away; then the external pressure from the
example of the peoples they were to conquer was
to be minimised by the practice of the ban. The first
five verses, and the last two deal emphatically with
that, as also does ver. 16, and what lies between is a
statement of the grounds upon which a strict execution
of this dreadful measure was demanded. These, as is
usual in Deuteronomy, are dealt with somewhat discursively;
but the command as to the ban, coming as it
does at the beginning, middle, and end, gives this
chapter unity, and suggests that it should be treated under
this head as a whole. There are besides other passages
which can most conveniently be discussed in connection
with chapter vii. These are the historic statements
as to the ban having been laid upon the cities of Sihon
(Deut. ii. 34) and Og (Deut. iii. 6); the provision for
the extirpation of idolatrous persons and communities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
(Deut. xiii. 15); and lastly, that portion of the law of war
which treats of the variations in the execution of the ban
which circumstances might demand (Deut. xx. 13-18).
These passages, taken together, give an almost exhaustive
statement in regard to the nature and limitations of the
Cherem, or ban, in ancient Israel, a statement much more
complete than is elsewhere to be found; and they consequently
suggest, if they do not demand, a complete
investigation of the whole matter.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the Cherem, or ban, by which a
person or thing, or even a whole people and their property,
were devoted to a god, was not a specially Mosaic
ordinance, for it is a custom known to many half-civilised
and some highly civilised nations. In Livy's account of
early Rome we read that Tarquinius, after defeating the
Sabines, burned the spoils of the enemy in a huge heap, in
accordance with a vow to Vulcan, made before advancing
into the Sabine country. The same custom is alluded to in
Vergil, <i>√Ün.</i> viii. 562, and C√¶sar, <i>B.G.</i> vi. 17, tells us a
similar thing of the Gauls. The Mexican custom of sacrificing
all prisoners of war to the god of war was of the
same kind. But the most complete example of the ban
in the Hebrew sense, occurring among a foreign people,
is to be found in the Moabite stone which Mesha, king of
Moab, erected in the ninth century <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.e.</i> in the days
of Ahab. Of course Moab and Israel were related peoples,
and it might in itself be possible that Moab during its
subjection to Israel had adopted the ban from Israel.
But that is highly improbable, considering how widespread
this custom is, and how deeply its roots are fixed
in human nature. Rather we should take the Moabite
ban as an example of its usual form among the Semitic
peoples. "And Chemosh said to me, Go, take Nebo
against Israel. And I went by night and fought against it
from the break of morn until noon, and took it and killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
them all, seven thousand men and boys, and women and
girls and maid-servants, for I had devoted it to 'Ashtor-Chemosh';
and I took thence the vessels" (so Renan) "of
Yahweh, and I dragged them before Chemosh."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The
ordinary Semitic word for the ban is <i>Cherem</i>. It denotes
a thing separated from or prohibited to common use, and
no doubt it indicated originally merely that which was
given over to the gods, separated for their exclusive use
for ever. In this way it was distinguished from that
which was "sanctified" to Yahweh, for that could be
redeemed; devoted things could not.</p>

<p>In the ancient laws repeated in Lev. xxvii. 28, 29,
two classes of devoted things seem to be referred to.
First of all, we have the things which an individual may
devote to God, "whether of man or beast, or of the field
of his possession." The provision made in regard to
them is that they shall not be sold or redeemed, but
shall become in the highest degree sacred to Yahweh.
Men so devoted, therefore, became perpetual slaves at
the holy places, and other kinds of property fell to the
priests. In the next verse, 29, we read, "None devoted
which shall be devoted of" (<i>i.e.</i> from among) "men shall
be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death," but that
must refer to some other class of men devoted to Yahweh.
It is inconceivable that in Israel individuals could at their
own will devote slaves or children to death. Moreover,
if every man devoted must be killed, the provision of
Numb. xviii. 14, according to which everything devoted in
Israel is to be Aaron's, could not be carried out. Further,
there is a difference in expression in the two verses: in
28 we have things "devoted to Yahweh," in 29 we have
simply men "devoted."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> There can be little doubt, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that we have in ver. 29 the case of men condemned
for some act for which the punishment prescribed by the
law was the ban (as in Exod. xxii. 19, "He that sacrificeth
unto any god save unto Yahweh only shall be put
to the ban"), or which some legal tribunal considered
worthy of that punishment. In such cases, the object of
the ban being something offensive, something which called
out the Divine wrath and abhorrence, this "devotion" to
God meant utter destruction. Just as <i>anathƒìma</i>, a thing
set up in a temple as a votive offering, became <i>anathƒïma</i>,
an accursed thing, and as <i>sacer</i>, originally meaning sacred,
came to mean devoted to destruction, so <i>Cherem</i>, among
the Semites, came to have the meaning of a thing devoted
to destruction by the wrath of the national gods. From
ancient days it had been in use, and in Israel it continued
to be practised, but with a new moral and religious purpose
which antiquity could know nothing of. No more
conspicuous instance of that transformation of ancient
customs of a doubtful or even evil kind by the spirit of
the religion of Yahweh, which is one of the most remarkable
characteristics of the history of Israel, can be conceived
than this use of the ban for higher ends.</p>

<p>As the fundamental idea of the <i>Cherem</i> was the devoting
of objects to a god, it is manifest that the whole inner
significance of the institution would vary with the conception
of the Deity. Among the worshippers of cruel
and sanguinary gods, such as the gods of the heathen
Semites were, the ends which this practice was used to
promote would naturally be cruel and sanguinary. Moreover,
where it was thought that the gods could be bought
over by acceptable sacrifices, where they were conceived
of as non-moral beings, whose reasons for favour or anger
were equally capricious and unfathomable, it was inevitable
that the <i>Cherem</i> should be mainly used to bribe these gods
to favour and help their peoples. Where victory seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
easy and within the power of the nation, the spoil and the
inhabitants of a conquered city or country would be taken
by the conquerors for their own use. Where, on the
other hand, victory was difficult and doubtful, an effort
would be made to win the favour of the god, and wring
success from him by promising him all the spoil. The
slaughter of the captives would be considered the highest
gratification such sanguinary gods could receive, while
their pride would be held to be gratified by the utter
destruction of the seat of the worship of other gods.
Obviously it was in this way that the Gauls and Germans
worked this institution; and the probability is that the
heathen Semites would view the whole matter from an
even lower standpoint. But to true worshippers of Yahweh
such thoughts must have grown abhorrent. From the
moment when their God became the centre and the norm
of moral life to Israel, acts which had no scope but the
gratification of a thirst for blood, or of a petty jealous
pride, could not be thought acceptable to Him. Every
institution and custom, therefore, which had no moral
element in it, had either to be swept away, or moralised
in the spirit of the purer faith. Now the ban was not
abolished in Israel; but it was moralised, and turned into
a potent and terrible weapon for the preservation and
advancement of true religion.</p>

<p>By the Divine appointment the national life of Israel
was bound up with the foundation and progress of true
religion. It was in this people that the seeds of the
highest religion were to be planted, and it was by means
of it that all the nations of the earth were to be blessed.
But as the chief means to this end was to be the higher
ethical and religious character of the nation as such, the
preservation of that from depravation and decay became
the main anxiety of the prophets and priests and law-givers
of Israel. Just as in modern days the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and defence of the State is reckoned in every country the
supreme law which overrides every other consideration, so
in Israel the preservation of the higher life was regarded.
Rude and half-civilised as Israel was at the beginning of
its career, the Divinely revealed religion had made men
conscious of that which gave this people its unique value
both to God and men. They recognised that its glory
and strength lay in its thought of God, and in the
character which this impressed upon the corporate life,
as well as on the life of each individual. As we have
seen, this bred in them a consciousness of a higher calling,
of a higher obligation resting on them than upon others.
They consequently felt the necessity of guarding their
special character, and used the ban as their great weapon
to ward off the contagion of evil, and to give this character
room to develop itself. Its tremendous, even cruel,
power was directed in Israel to this end; it was from this
point of view alone that it had value in the eyes of the
fully enlightened man of Israel. Stade in his history
(vol. i., p. 490) holds that this distinction did not exist, that
the Israelite view differed in little, if anything, from that of
their heathen kinsmen, and that the ban resulted from a
vow intended to gratify Yahweh and win His favour by
giving Him the booty. But it is undeniable that in the
earliest statement in regard to it (Exod. xx.) there is a
distinct legislative provision that the ban should be
proclaimed and executed irrespective of any vow; and
in the later, but still early, notices of it in Joshua, Judges,
and 1 Samuel the command to execute it comes in every
case from Yahweh. In Deuteronomy, again, the ethical
purpose of the ban is always insisted upon, most emphatically
perhaps in chap. xx. 17 ff., where the <i>Cherem</i> is laid
down as a regular practice in war against the heathen
inhabitants of Canaan: "But thou shalt utterly destroy
them, ... that they teach you not to do after all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so
should ye sin against Yahweh your God." Whatever hints
or appearances there may be in the Scripture narratives
that the lower view still clung to some minds are not to
be taken as indicating the normal and recognised view.
They were, like much else of a similar kind, mere survivals,
becoming more and more shadowy as the history advances,
and at last entirely vanishing away. The new and higher
thought which Moses planted was the rising and prevailing
element in the Israelite consciousness. The lower
thought was a decaying reminiscence of the state of things
which the Mosaic revelation had wounded to the death,
but which was slow in dying.</p>

<p>In Israel, therefore, the ban was, on the principles of
the higher religion, legitimate only where the object
was to preserve that religion when gravely endangered.
If any object could justify a measure so cruel and
sweeping as the ban, this could, and this is the only
ground upon which the Scriptures defend it. That the
danger was grave and imminent, when Israel entered
Canaan, cannot be doubted. As we have seen, the
Israelite tribes were far from being of one blood or of
one faith. There was a huge mixed multitude along
with them; and even among those who had unquestioned
title to be reckoned among Israelites, many were gross,
carnal, and slavish in their conceptions of things. They
had not learned thoroughly nor assimilated the lessons
they had been taught. Only the elect among them had
done that; and the danger from contact with races,
superior in culture, and religiously not so far below
the position occupied by the multitude of Israel, was
extreme. The nation was born in a day, but it had been
educated only for a generation; it was raw and ignorant
in all that concerned the Yahwistic faith. In fact it was
precisely in the condition in which spiritual disease could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
be most easily contracted and would be most deadly.
The new religion had not been securely organised; the
customs and habits of the people still needed to be moulded
by it, and could not, consequently, act as the stay and
support of religion as they did at later times. Further,
the people were at the critical moment when they were
passing from one stage of social life to another. At such
moments there is immense danger to the health and
character of a nation, for there is no unity of ideal present
to every mind. That which they are moving away from
has not ceased to exert its influence, and that <em>to</em> which
they are moving has not asserted itself with all its power.
At such crises in the career of peoples emerging from
barbarism, even physical disease is apt to be deadlier and
more prevalent than it is among either civilised or
entirely savage men. The old Semitic heathenism had
not been entirely overcome, and the new and higher
religion had not succeeded in establishing full dominion.
Contact with the Canaanites in almost any shape would
under such circumstances be like the introduction of a
contagious disease, and at almost any price it had to be
avoided. The customs of the world at that time, and of
the Semitic nations in particular, offered this terribly
effective weapon of the "ban," and for this higher purpose
it was accepted; and it was enforced with a stringency
which nothing would justify short of the fact that life or
death to the great hope of mankind was involved in it.</p>

<p>But it may be and should be asked, Would any circumstances
justify Christian men, or a Christian nation, in
entering upon a war of extermination now? and if not,
how can a war of extermination against the Canaanities
have been sanctioned by God? In answer to the first
question, it must be said that, while circumstances can
be conceived under which the extermination of a race
would certainly be carried out by nations called Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
it is hardly possible to imagine Christian men taking part
in such a massacre. Even the supposed command of
God could not induce them to do so.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It would be so
contrary to all that they have learned of God's will, both
as regards themselves and others, that they would
hesitate. Almost certainly they would decide that they
were bound to be faithful to what God had revealed of
Himself; they would feel that He could not wish to blunt
their moral sense and undo what He had done for them,
and they would put aside the command as a temptation.
But the case with the Israelites was altogether
different. The question is not, how could God destroy
a whole people? Were it only that, there would be little
difficulty. Everywhere in His action through nature
God is ruthless enough against sin. Vice and sin are
every day bringing men and women and innocent children
to death, and to suffering worse than death. For that
every believer in God holds the Divine law responsible.
And when the Divine command was laid upon the Israelites
to do, more speedily, and in a more awe-inspiring way,
what Canaanite vices were already doing, there can be no
difficulty except in so far as the effect upon the Israelites
is concerned. It is by death, inflicted as the punishment
of vice, and sparing neither woman nor child, that nations
have, as a rule, been blotted out; and, except to the
confused thinker, so far as the Divine action is concerned
there is no difference between such cases and this of the
Canaanites. The real question is, Can a living, personal
God deliberately set to men a task which can only lower
them in the scale of humanity&mdash;brutalise them, in fact?
No, is of course the only possible answer; therefore a
supposed Divine command coming to us to do such
things would rightly be suspected. We could not, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
feel sure, be called upon by God to slay the innocent
with the guilty, to overwhelm in one common punishment
individual beings who have each of them an inalienable
claim to justice at our hands. But the Israelites had
not and could not have the feeling we have on the subject.
The feeling for the individual did not exist in early
times. The clan, the tribe, the nation was everything,
and the individual nothing. Consequently there was
not existent in the world that keen feeling in regard
to individual rights, which dominates us so completely that
we can with difficulty conceive any other view. In this
world the early Israelite scarcely perceived the individual
man, and beyond this world he knew of no certain career
for him. He consequently dealt with him only as part of
his clan or tribe. His tribe suffered for him and he for
his tribe, and in early penal law the two could hardly be
separated. Indeed it may almost be said that, when the
individual suffered for his own sin, the satisfaction felt by
the wronged was rather due to the tribe having suffered
so much loss in the individual's death than to the retribution
which fell upon him. Moreover war was the
constant employment of all, and death by violence the
most common of all forms of death. Manners and feelings
were both rude, and the pains as well as the pleasures of
civilised and Christian men lay largely beyond their
horizon. There was consequently no danger of doing
violence to nobler feelings or of leaving a sting in the conscience
by calling such men to such work. The stage of
moral development they had reached did not forbid it, and
the work therefore might be given them of God.</p>

<p>But the grounds for the action were immeasurably raised.
Instead of being left on the heathen level, "the usage was
utilised so as to harmonise with the principles of their
religion, and to satisfy its needs. It became a mode of
secluding and rendering harmless anything which peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
imperilled the religious life of either an individual
or the community, such objects being withdrawn from
society at large, and presented to the sanctuary, which had
power, if needful, to authorise their destruction."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The
Deuteronomic command is not given shamefacedly. The
interests at stake are too great for that. Israel is utterly
to smite the Canaanite nations, to put them to the ban, to
make no covenant with them nor to intermarry with them.
"Thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their
altars, and dash in pieces their obelisks, and hew down
their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire."
There is a fierce, curt energy about the words which
impresses the reader with the vigour needed to defend the
true religion. The danger was seen to be great, and this
tremendous weapon of the ban was to be wielded with
unsparing rigour, if Israel was to be true to its highest
call. "For," ver. 6 goes on to say, "thou art a holy
people unto Yahweh thy God; Yahweh thy God hath
chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself, out of
all peoples that are upon the face of the earth." They
were the elect of God; they were a holy people, a people
separated unto their God, and the Divine blessing was to
come upon all nations through them if they remained true.
Their separateness must therefore be maintained. As a
people marked out by the love of God, they could not share
in the common life of the world as it then was. They
could not lift the Canaanites to their level by mingling
with them. So they would only obscure, nay, in so
far as this rigorous command was not carried out,
they did all but fatally obscure, the higher elements
of national and personal life which they had received.
They were too recently converted to be the people of
Yahweh, too weak in their own faith, to be able to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
anything but stand in this austere and repellent attitude
towards the world. Centuries passed before they could
relax without danger. It may even be said that until the
coming of our Lord they dared not take up any other than
this separatist position, though as the ages passed and the
prophetic influence grew, the yearning after a gathering in
of the Gentiles, and the promise of it in the Messianic
day, became more markedly prominent. Only when men
could look forward to being made perfect in Jesus Christ
did they receive the command to go unreservedly out into
the world, for only then had they an anchor which no
storm in the world could drag.</p>

<p>But we must be careful not to exaggerate the separation
called for here. It does not authorise anything like the
fierce, intolerant thirst for conquest and domination which
was the very keynote of Islam.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In Deut. ii. 5, 6, 19, the
lands of Edom, Moab, and Ammon are said to be Yahweh's
gift to these peoples in the same way as Canaan was to Israel.
Nor did the law ever authorise the bitter and contemptuous
feeling with which Pharisaic Israelites often regarded
all men beyond the pale of Judaism. There was no general
prohibition against friendly intercourse with other peoples.
It was against those only, whose presence in Canaan would
have frustrated the establishment of the theocracy, and
whose influence would have been destructive of it when
established, that the "ban" was decreed. When war arose
between Israel and cities farther off than those of Canaan,
they were not to be put to the "ban." Though they were
to be hardly treated according to our ideas, they were to
suffer only the fate of cities stormed in those days, for
the danger of corruption was proportionately diminished
(Deut. xx. 17) by their distance. The right of other peoples
to their lands was to be respected, and friendly intercourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
might be entered on with them. But the right of
Israel to the free and unhindered development to which it
had been called by Yahweh was the supreme law. The
suspicion of danger to that was to make things otherwise
harmless, or even useful, to be abhorred. If men are to
live nearer to God than others, they must sacrifice much
to the higher call.</p>

<p>To press home this, to induce Israel to respond to this
demand, to convince them anew of their obligation to go
any length to keep their position as a people holy to
Yahweh, our chapter urges a variety of reasons. The
first (vv. 7-11) is that the history and grounds of their
election exhibit the character of Yahweh in such a way
as to heighten their sense of their privileges and the
danger of losing them. He had chosen them, only
because of His own love to them; and having chosen
them and sworn to their fathers, He is true to His
covenant. He brought them out of the house of bondage,
and has led them until now. In Yahweh they had
a spiritual ideal, whose characteristics were love and faithfulness.
But though He loves He can be wrathful, and
though He has made a covenant with Israel, it must be
fulfilled in accordance with righteousness. In dealing
with such a God they must beware of thinking that their
election is irrespective of moral conditions, or that His love
is mere good nature. He can and does smite the enemies
of good, for anger is always possible where love is. It is
only with good nature that anger is not compatible, just as
warm and self-sacrificing affection also is. Those who
turn away from Him, therefore, He requites immediately
to their face, as surely as "He keepeth covenant and
mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments."
All the blessed and intimate relations which He
has opened up with them, and in which their safety and
their glory lie, can be dissolved by sin. They are, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to strike fiercely at temptation, to regard neither
their own lives nor the lives of others when that has to be
put out of the way, to smite and spare not, for the very
love of God.</p>

<p>A second reason why they should obey the Divine
commands, as in other matters, so in this terrible thing, is
this. If they be willing and obedient, then God will bless
them in temporal ways as well as with spiritual blessings.
Even for their earthly prosperity a loyal attitude to
Yahweh would prove decisive. "Thou shalt be blessed
above all peoples; there shall not be a male or female
barren among you, or among your cattle. And Yahweh
will take away from thee all sickness, and He will put
none of the evil diseases of Egypt which thou knowest
upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate
thee." The same promises are renewed in more detail
and with greater emphasis in the speech contained in
chapters xxviii. and xxix. There the significance of such
a view, and the difficulties involved in it for us, will be
fully discussed. Here it will be sufficient to note that
the profit of obedience is brought in to induce Israel to
enforce the "ban" most rigorously.</p>

<p>The last verses of our chapter, vv. 17-26, set before
Israel a third incitement and encouragement. Yahweh,
who had proved His might and His favour for them by
His mighty deeds in Egypt, would be among them, to
make them stronger than their mightiest foes (ver. 21):
"Thou shalt not be affrighted at them, for Yahweh thy
God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible."
The previous inducements to obey Yahweh their God and
be true to Him were founded on His character and on
His acts. He was merciful; but He could be terrible,
and He would reward the faithful with prosperity. Now
His people are encouraged to go forward because His
presence will go with them. In the conflicts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
obedience to Him would provoke, He would be with them
to sustain them, whatever stress might come upon them.
Step by step they would drive out those very peoples
whom they had dreaded so when the spies brought back
their report of the land. The terror of their God would
fall upon all these nations. A great God and a terrible
He would prove Himself to be, and with Him in their
midst they might go forth boldly to execute the ban upon
the Canaanites. The sins and vices of these peoples had
brought this upon them; their horrible worship left an
indelible stain wherever its shadow fell. Israel, led and
directed by Yahweh Himself, was to fall upon them as
the scourge of God.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Divine urgency, the command to
destroy the Canaanites and their idols was not carried
out. After a victory or two the enemy began to submit.
Glad to be rid of the toils of war, Israel settled down
among the people of the land. All central control would
seem to have disappeared. The Canaanite worship and
the Canaanite customs attracted and fascinated the people,
and enemy after enemy broke in upon them and triumphed
over them. The half-idolatrous masses were led away
into depraved forms of worship, and for a time it looked
as if the work of Moses would be utterly undone. Had
the purer faith he taught them not been revived, Israel
would probably not have survived the period of the
Judges. As it was, they just survived; but by their lapse
the leavening of the whole of the nation with the pure
principles of Yahweh-worship had been stopped. Instead
of being cured, the idolatrous inclinations they had
brought with them from the pre-Mosaic time had been
revived and strengthened. Multitudes, while calling
Yahweh their God, had sunk almost to the Canaanite
level in their worship, and during the whole period of
their existence as a nation Israel as a whole never again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
rose clear of half-heathen conceptions of their God. The
prophets taught and threatened them in vain, until at last
ruin fell upon them and the Divine threats of punishment
were fulfilled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><i>THE BAN IN MODERN LIFE</i></h3>


<p>In our modern time this practice of the ban has, of
course, become antiquated and impossible. The
<i>Cherem</i>, or ban, of the modern synagogue is a different
thing, based upon different motives, and is directed to
the same ends as Christian excommunication. But though
the thing has ceased, the principles underlying it, and the
view of life which it implies, are of perpetual validity.
These belong to the essential truths of religion, and
especially need to be recalled in a time like ours, when
men tend everywhere to a feeble, lax, and cosmopolitan
view of Christianity. As we have seen, the fundamental
principle of the <i>Cherem</i> was that, however precious,
however sacred, however useful and helpful in ordinary
circumstances a thing might be, whenever it became
dangerous to the higher life it should at once be given
up to Yahweh. The lives of human beings, even though
they were men's dearest and nearest, should be sacrificed;
the richest works of art, the weapons of war, and the
wealth which would have adorned life and made it easy,
were equally to be given up to Him, that He might seclude
them and render them harmless to men's highest interests.
Neighbourliness to the Canaanites was absolutely forbidden,
and the Church of the Old Testament was commanded
to take up a position of hostility, or at best of armed
neutrality, to all the pleasures, interests, and concerns of
the peoples who surrounded them. Now the prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
modern view is that not only the ban itself, but these
principles have become obsolete. Notwithstanding that
the Church of the New Testament is the bearer of the
higher interests of humanity, we are taught that when
it is least definite in its direction ·ºÑas to conduct, when it
is most tolerant of the practices of the world, then it is
most true to its original conception. We are told that
an indulgent Church is what is wanted; rigour and
religion are now supposed to be finally divorced in all
enlightened minds. This view is not often categorically
expressed, but it underlies all fashionable religion, and
has its apostles in the golden youth who forward enlightenment
by playing tennis on Sundays. Because of it too,
Puritan has become a name of scorn, and careless self-gratification
a mark of cultured Christianity. Not only
asceticism, but ·ºÑœÉŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ has been discredited, and the moral
tone of society has perceptibly fallen in consequence. In
wide circles both within and without the Church it seems
to be held that pain is the only intolerable evil, and in
legislation as well as in literature that idea has been
registering itself.</p>

<p>For much of this progress, as some call it, no reasoned
justification has been attempted, but it has been defended
in part by the allegation that the circumstances which
make the "ban" necessary to the very life of the ancient
people of God have passed away, now that social and
political life has been Christianised. Even those who
are outside the Church in Christian lands are no longer
living at a moral and spiritual level so much below that
of the Church. They are not heathen idolaters, whose
moral and religious ideas are contagiously corrupting,
and nothing but Pharisaism of the worst type, it is said,
can justify the Church in taking up a position to society
in any degree like that which was imposed upon ancient
Israel. Now it cannot be denied that there is truth here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and in so far as the Christian Church or individual Christians
have taken up precisely the same position to those
without as is implied in the Old Testament ban, they
are not to be defended. Modern society, as at present
constituted, is not corrupting like that of Canaan. No
one in a modern Christian state has been brought up in
an atmosphere of heathenism, and what an incredible
difference that involves only those who know heathenism
well can appreciate. If spiritual life is neither understood
nor believed in by all, yet the rules of morals are the
same in every mind, and these rules are the product of
Christianity. As a consequence, the Church is not
endangered in the same way and to the same degree by
contact with the world as in the ancient days. Indeed
to the Israelite of the post-Mosaic time our "world,"
which some sects at least would absolutely ignore and
shut out, would seem a very definite and legitimate
part of the Church. The Jewish Church was certainly
to a very large extent made up of precisely such elements,
while those who were to be put to the ban were far more
remote than any citizens of a modern state, except a
portion of the criminal class. Further, those not actively
Christian are, on account of this community of moral
sentiments, open to appeal from the Church as the heathen
Canaanites were not. In English-speaking lands, while
there are multitudes indifferent to Christianity, most
acknowledge the obligation of the Christian motives. In
nations at least nominally Christian, therefore, both
because the danger of corruption is greatly less, and
because the world is more accessible to the leaven of
Christian life, no Church can, or dare, without incurring
terrible loss and responsibility, withdraw from or show
a merely hostile front to the world. The sects which do
so live an invalid life. Their virtues take on the sickly
look of all "fugitive and cloistered virtue." Their doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
become full of the "idols of the cave," and they cease to
have any perception of the real needs of men.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the austere spirit inculcated in this chapter
must be kept alive, if the Church is to be the spiritual
leader of humanity, for strenuousness is the great want
of modern life. Dr. Pearson, whose book on <cite>National
Life and Character</cite> has lately expounded the theory that
the Church, "being too inexorable in its ideal to admit
of compromises with human frailty, is precisely on this
account unfitted for governing fallible men and women,"
i.e. governing them in the political sense, has elsewhere
stated his view of the remedy for one of the great evils
of modern life.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> "The disproportionate growth of the
distributing classes, as compared with the producing, is
due, I believe, to two moral causes&mdash;the love of amusement
and the passion for speculation. Men flock out of
healthy country lives in farms or mines into our great
cities, because they like to be near the theatre and the
racecourse, or because they hope to grow rich suddenly
by some form of gambling. The cure for a taint of this
kind is not economical but religious, and can only be
found, I am convinced, in a return to the masculine
asceticism that has distinguished the best days of history,
Puritan or Republican." This is emphatically true of
Australia, where and of which the words were first
spoken; and masculine asceticism of the Puritan type
would cure many another evil there besides these. But
the same thing is true everywhere; and if religion is to
cure slackness in social or political life, how much more
must it cultivate this austere spirit for itself! The function
of the Church is not to govern the world; it seeks
rather to inspire the world. It should lead the advance
to a higher, more ennobling life, and should exhibit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in its own collective action and in the kind of character
it produces. Its greatest gift to the world should be itself,
and it is useful only when it is true to its own <em>ethos</em> and
spirit. To keep that unimpaired must therefore be its
first duty, and to fulfil that duty it must keep rigorously
back from everything which, in relation to its own existing
state, would be likely to lower the power of its peculiar
life. The State must often compromise with human
frailty. Often there will be before the legislator and
the statesman only a choice between two evils, or at least
two undesirable courses, unless a worse thing is to be
tolerated. The Church, on the other hand, should keep
close to the ideal as it sees it. Its reason for existence
is that it may hold up the ideal to men, and exhibit it
as far as that may be. Compromise in regard to that
is impossible for the Church, for that would be nothing
else than disloyalty to its own essential principle. The
spirit, therefore, that inspired the "ban" must always be
living and powerful in the Church. Whatever is dangerous
to the special Christian life must cease to exist for Christians.
It should be laid at the feet of their Divine Head,
that He may seclude it from His people and render it
innocuous. Many things that are harmless or even useful
at a lower level of life must be refused a place by the
Christian. Gratifications that cannot but seem good to
others must be refused by him; for he seeks to be in the
forefront of the battle against evil, to be the pioneer to a
more whole-hearted spiritual life.</p>

<p>But that does not imply that we should seek to renew
the various imperfect and external devices by which past
times sought to attain this exceedingly desirable end.
Experience has taught the folly and futility of sumptuary
laws, for example. Their only effect was to do violence
to the inwardness which belongs of necessity to spiritual
life. They externalised and depraved morality, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
finally defeated themselves. Nor would the later Puritanism,
with its rigidity as regards dress and deportment,
and its narrow and limited view of life, help us much
more. It began doubtless with the right principle; but
it sought to bind all to its observances, whether they
cared for the spirit of them or not; and it showed a
measureless intemperance in regard to the things which
it declared hostile to the life of faith. In that form it has
been charged with "isolation from human history, human
enjoyment, and all the manifold play and variety of
human character." For a short time, however, Puritanism
did strike the golden mean in this matter, and probably
we could not in this present connection find a better
example for modern days than in the Puritanism of
Spenser, of Colonel Hutchinson (one of the regicides so
called), and of Milton. Their united lives covered the
heroic period of Puritanism, and taken in their order they
represent very fairly its rise, its best estate, and its
tendencies towards harsh extremes, when as yet it was
but a tendency.</p>

<p>Spenser, born in the "spacious times of great Elizabeth,"
was politically and nationally a Puritan, and in
aim and ideal, at least, was so in his stern view of life and
religion.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> His attachment to Lord Grey of Wilton, that
personally kind yet absolutely ruthless executor of the
English "ban" against the untamable Irish, and his
defence of his policy, show the one; while his <cite>Fairy
Queen</cite>, with its representation of religion as "the foundation
of all nobleness in man" and its dwelling upon man's
victory over himself, reveals the other. But he had in
him also elements belonging to that strangely mingled
world in which he lived, and which came from an entirely
different source. He had the Elizabethan enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
for beauty, the large delight in life as such even where
its moral quality was questionable, and the artist's
sensitiveness and adaptability in a very high degree.
These diverse elements were never fully interfused in
him. Amid all the gracious beauty of his work, there is
the trace of discord and the mark of conflict; and at
times perhaps his life fell into courses which spoke little
of self-control. But his face was always in the main
turned upwards. In the main, too, his life corresponded
with his aspirations. He combined his poetic gift, his
love of men and human life, with a faithfulness to his
ideal of conduct which, if not always perfect, was sincere,
and was, too, as we may hope, ultimately victorious.
The Puritan in him had not entire victory over the
worldling, but it had the mastery; and the very imperfection
of the victory kept the character in sympathy
with the whole of life.</p>

<p>In Colonel Hutchinson,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> as depicted in that stately and
tender panegyric which speaks to us across more than
two centuries so pathetically of his wife's almost adoring
love, we see the Puritan character in its fullest and most
balanced form. We do not, of course, mean that his
mind had the imaginative power of Spenser's, or his
character the force of Milton's; but partly from circumstances,
partly by singular grace of nature, his character
possessed a stability and an equilibrium which had not
come when Spenser lived, and which was beginning to
go in the evil days upon which Milton fell. At the
root of all his virtues his wife sets "that which was
the head and spring of them all, his Christianity."
"By Christianity," she says, "I intend that universal
habit of grace which is wrought in a soul by the regenerating
Spirit of God, whereby the whole creature is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
resigned up into the Divine will and love, and all its
actions designed to the obedience and glory of its Maker."
He had been trained in a Puritan home, and though
when he went out into the world he had to face quite
the average temptations of a rich and well-born youth,
he fled all youthful lusts. But he did not retire from the
world. "He could dance admirably well, but neither in
youth nor riper years made any practice of it; he had
skill in fencing such as became a gentleman; he had a
great love to music, and often diverted himself with a viol,
on which he played masterly; he had an exact ear, and
judgment in other music; he shot excellently in bows
and guns, and much used them for his exercise; he had
great judgment in painting, graving, sculpture, and all
liberal arts, and had many curiosities of value in all kinds.
He took much pleasure in improvement of grounds, in
planting groves and walks and fruit-trees, in opening
springs and making fishponds. Of country recreations
he loved none but hawking, and in that was very eager,
and much delighted for the time he used it." Hutchinson
was no ascetic, therefore, in the wrong sense, but lived in
and enjoyed the world as a man should. But perhaps his
greatest divergence from the lower Puritanism lay in
this, that "everything that it was necessary for him to
do he did with delight, free and unconstrained." Moreover,
though he adopted strong Puritan opinions in
theology, "he hated persecution for religion, and was
always a champion for all religious people against all
their great oppressors. Nevertheless self-restraint was
the law of his life, and he many times forbore things
lawful and delightful to him, rather than he would
give any one occasion of scandal." In public affairs
he took the courageous part of a man who sought
nothing for himself, and was moved only by his hatred
of wrong to leave the prosperity and peace of his home-life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
He became a member of the Court which tried
the King against his will, but signed the warrant for
his death, simply because he conceived it to be his
duty. When the Restoration came and he was challenged
for his conduct, scorning the subterfuges of
some who declared they signed under compulsion, he
quietly accepted the responsibility for his acts. This
led to his death in the flower of his age, through imprisonment
in the Tower; but he never flinched, "having
made up his accounts with life and death, and fixed his
purpose to entertain both honourably." From the
beginning of his life to the end there was a consistent
sanity, which is rare at any time, and was especially rare
in those days. His loyalty to God kept him austerely
aloof from unworthiness, while it seemed to add zest to
the sinless joys which came in his way. Above all, it
never suffered him to forget that the true Christian
temper and character was the pearl of price which all
else he had might lawfully be sacrificed to purchase.</p>

<p>In the character of Milton we find the same essential
elements, the same purity in youth, which, with his
beauty, won for him the name of the Lady of his College;
the same courage and public spirit in manhood; the same
love of music and of culture. After his University career
he retired to his father's house, and read all Greek and
Latin literature, as well as Italian, and studied Hebrew
and some other Oriental languages. All the culture of
his time, therefore, was absorbed by him, and his mind
and speech were shot through and through with the
brilliant colours of the history and romance of many
climes. Almost no kind of beauty failed to appeal to him,
but the austerity of his views of life kept him from being
enslaved by it. In his earlier works even, he caught in
a surprising way all the glow, and splendour, and poetic
fervour of the English Renaissance; but he joined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
it the sternest and most uncompromising Puritan morality,
not only in theory and desire like Spenser, but in the
hard practice of actual life. When the idea of duty comes
to dominate a man, the grace and impetuosity of youth,
the overmastering love of beauty, and the appreciation
of the mere joy of living are apt to die away, and the
poetic fire burns low. But it was not so with Milton. To
the end of his life he remained a true Elizabethan,
but an Elizabethan who had always kept himself free
from the chains of sensual vice, and had never stained his
purity of soul. That fact makes him unique almost in
English history, and has everywhere added a touch of
the sublime to all that his works have of beauty. "His
soul was like a star, and dwelt apart:" and we may
entirely believe what he tells us of himself when he
returned from his European travels: "In all the places
in which vice meets with so little discouragement, and is
protected with so little shame, I never once turned from
the path of integrity and virtue, and perpetually reflected
that, though my conduct might escape the notice of men,
it could not elude the inspection of God." Like the
true Puritan he was, Milton not only overcame evil in
himself, but he thought his own life and health a cheap
price to pay for the overthrow of evil wherever he saw it.
When the civil war broke out, he returned at once from
his travels, to help to right the wrongs of his country.
In the service of the Government he sacrificed his poetic
gift, his leisure for twenty years, and finally his sight,
to the task of defending England from her enemies. But
he did not stop there. His severity became excessive,
at times almost vindictive. When he wrote prose he
scarcely ever wrote without having an enemy to crush,
and much that he uttered in this vein cannot possibly
be approved. His pamphlets are unfair to a degree which
shows that his mind had lost balance in the turmoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of the great struggle, so that he approached at moments
the narrower Puritanism. But he still proved himself
too great for that, and emerged anew as a great and
lofty spirit, held down very little by earthly bonds, and
strenuously set against evil as a true servant of God.</p>

<p>Now the temper of Puritanism such as this of these
old English worthies is precisely what Christians need
most to cultivate in these days. They must be animated
by the spirit which refuses to touch, and refers to God,
whatever proves hostile to life in God; but they must
also combine with this aloofness a sympathetic hold on
ordinary life. It is easy on the one hand to solve all
problems by cutting oneself off from any relation with
the world, lest the inner life should suffer. It is also easy
to let the inner life take care of itself, and to float blithely
on with all the currents of life which are not deadly sins.
But it is not easy to keep the mind and life open to all
the great life-streams which tend to deepen and enrich
human nature, and yet to stand firm in self-control,
determined that nothing which drags down the soul
shall be permitted to fascinate or overpower. To this
task Christian men and the Christian Church seem at
present to be specially called. It is admitted on all
hands that the ordinary Puritanism became too intolerant
of all except spiritual interests; so that it could not, without
infinite loss, have been accepted as the guide for all life.
But hence what was good in it has been rejected along
with the bad; and it needs to be restored, if a weak,
self-indulgent temper, which resents hardship or even
discipline, is not to gain the upper hand. In social life
especially this is needful, otherwise so much debate would
never have been expended on the question of amusements.
On the face of it, a Christianity which can go with the
world in all those of its amusements which are not
actually forbidden by the moral law must be a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
type of Christianity. It can be conscious of no special
character which it has to preserve, of no special voice
which it has to utter in the antiphony of created things.
Whatever others allow themselves, therefore, the vigilant
Christian must see to it that he does nothing which will
destroy his special contribution to the world he lives in.
It is precisely by that that he is the salt of the earth; and
if the salt have lost its savour wherewith will you season
it? No price is too great for the preservation of this
savour, and in reference to the care of it each man must
ultimately be a law unto himself. No one else can really
tell where his weakness lies. No one else can know
what the effect of this or that recreation upon that weakness
is.</p>

<p>When men lose spiritual touch with their own character
they are apt to throw themselves back for guidance in
such matters upon the general opinion of the Christian
community, or the tradition of the elders. In doing so they
are in danger of losing sincerity in a mass of formalism.
But if a vivid apprehension of the need of individuality
in the regulation of life is maintained, the formulated
Christian objection to certain customs or certain amusements
may be a most useful substitute for painful experience
of our own. Some such amusements may have been
banned in the past without sufficient reason; or they may
have been excluded only because of the special openness
to temptation of a certain community; or they may
have so changed their character that they do not now
deserve the ban which was laid upon them once justly
enough. Any plea, therefore, for the revisal or abolition
of standing conventions on such grounds must be listened
to and judged. But, on the whole, these standing prohibitions
of the Church represent accumulated experience,
and all young people especially will do wisely not to break
away from them. What the mass of Christians in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
past have found hurtful to the Christian character will in
most cases be hurtful still. For if it can be said of the
secular world in all matters of experience that "this wise
world is mainly right," it may surely be said also of the
Christian community. In our time there is a quite
justifiable distrust of conventionality in morals and in
religion; but it should not be forgotten that conventions
are not open to the same objection. They represent,
on the whole, merely the registered results of actual
experience, and they may be estimated and followed in
an entirely free spirit. It is not wise, therefore, to revolt
against them indiscriminately, merely because they may
be used cruelly against others, or may be taken as a
substitute for a moral nature by oneself. Thackeray in
his constant railing at the judgment of the world seems to
make this mistake. He is never weary in pointing out
how unjust the broad general judgments of the world are
to specially selected individuals. Harry Warrington in
<cite>The Virginians</cite>, for instance, though innocent, lives in a
manner and with associates which the world has generally
found to indicate intolerable moral laxity; and because the
world was wrong in thinking that to be true in his case
which would have been true in ninety-five out of a
hundred similar cases, the moralist rails at the evil-hearted
judgments of the world. But "this wise world
is mainly right," and its rough and indiscriminating
judgments fit the average case. They are part of the
great sanitary provision which society makes for its own
preservation. And the case is precisely similar with the
conventions of the religious life. They too are in the
main sanitary precautions, which a conscience thoroughly
alive and a strong intelligence may make superfluous, but
which for the unformed, the half-ignorant, the less original
natures, in a word, for average men and women, are
absolutely necessary. Spontaneity and freedom are admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
qualities in morals and religion. They are even the
conditions of the highest kinds of moral and religious life,
and the necessary presuppositions of health and progress.
But something is due to stability as well; and a world of
original and spontaneous moralists, trusting only to their
own "genial sense" of truth, would be a maddening
chaos. In other words, conventions if used unconventionally,
if not exalted into absolute moral laws disobedience
to which excludes from reputable society, if
taken simply as indications of the paths in which least
danger to the higher life has been found to lie, are guides
for which men may well be thankful.</p>

<p>In the world of thought too, as well as in the world
of action, a wise austerity of self-control is absolutely
necessary. The prevailing theory is that every one, young
men more especially, should read on all sides on all
questions, and that they should know and sympathise
with all modes of thought. This is advocated in the
supposed interests of freedom from external domination
and from internal prejudice. But in a great number of
cases the result does not follow. Such catholicity of taste
does produce a curious <i>dilettante</i> interest in lines of
thought, but as a rule it weakens interest in truth as such.
It delivers from the domination of a Church or other
historic authority; but only, in most cases, to hand over
the supposed freeman to the narrower domination of the
thinker or school by which he happens to be most impressed.
For it is vain and impotent to suppose that in regard
to morals and religion every mind is able to find its way
by free thought, when in regard to bodily health, or even
in questions of finance, the free thought of the amateur
is acknowledged to end usually in confusion. Those
only can usefully expose their minds to all the various
currents of modern thought who have a clear footing of
their own. Whatever that may be, it gives them a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
on which to stand, and a vantage-ground from which they
can gather up what widens or corrects their view. But
to leave the land altogether, and commit oneself to the
currents, is to render any after-landing all but impossible.
With regard to the books read, the lines of thought
followed, and the associations formed, the Christian
must exercise self-denial and self-examination. Whatever
is manifestly detrimental to his best life, whatever
he feels to be likely to taint the purity of his mind or
lower his spiritual vitality, should be put under the
"ban," should be resolutely avoided in all ordinary
cases. Of course modes of thought that deserve to
be weighed may be found mingled with such elements;
also views of life which have a truth and importance
of their own, though their setting is corrupt. But it
is not every one's business to extricate and discuss
these. Those who are called to it will have to do it;
and in doing it as a duty they may expect to be
kept from the lurking contagion. Every one else who
investigates them runs a risk which he was not called
upon to run. The average Christian should, therefore,
note all that tends to stunt or deprave him spiritually, and
should avoid it. It is not manliness but folly which makes
men read filthy literature because of its style, or sceptical
literature because of its ability, when they are not called
upon to do so, and when they have not fortified themselves
by the purity of the Scriptures and the power of
prayer. To make such literature or such modes of
thought our staple mental food, or to make the writers
or admirers of such books our intimate friends, is to sap
our own best convictions and to disregard our high
calling.</p>

<p>Lastly, however common it may be for men to sit down
in selfish isolation and devote themselves to their own
interests, even though these be spiritual, in the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
remediable evils, that is not the Christian manner of
acting. Of the great Puritans we mentioned, Spenser
endured hardness in that terrible Irish war which the
men of Elizabeth's day regarded as the war of good
against evil; Hutchinson fought for and died in the
cause of political and religious freedom; and Milton
devoted his life and health to the same cause. All of
them, the two latter especially, might have kept out of
it all, in the peace and comfort of private life; but they
judged that the destruction of evil was their first duty.
At the trumpet call they willingly took their side, and
prepared to give their lives, if necessary, for the righteous
cause. Now it is not enough for us to avoid evil any
more than it was for them. Though personal influence
and example are undoubtedly among the most potent
weapons in the warfare for the Kingdom of God, there
must be, besides these, the power and the will to put
public evils under the ban. Whatever institution or
custom or law is ungodly, whatever in our social life
is manifestly unjust, should stir the Christian Church
to revolt against it, and should fill the heart of the
individual Christian with an undying energy of hatred. It
is not meant that the Christian Churches as such should
transform themselves into political societies or social clubs.
To do that would simply be to abdicate their only real
functions. But they should be the sources of such teaching
as will turn men's thoughts towards social justice and
political righteousness, and should prepare them for the
sacrifice which any great improvement in the social state
must demand of some. Further, every individual Christian
should feel that his responsibility for the condition of his
brethren, those of his own nation, is very great and direct;
that to discharge municipal and political duty with conscientious
care is a primary obligation. Only so can
the power be gained to "ban" the bad laws, the unjust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
practices, the evil social customs, which disfigure our
civilisation, which degrade and defraud the poor.</p>

<p>A militant Puritanism here is not only a necessity for
further social progress, but it is also a necessity for the
full exhibition of the power and the essential sympathies
of Christianity. For want of it the working classes in
their movement upward have not only been alienated from
the Churches, but they have learned to demand of their
leaders that they shall "countenance the poor man in his
cause." They are tempted to require their leaders to
share not only their common principles, but their prejudices;
and they often look with suspicion upon those
who insist upon applying the plumb-line of justice to the
demands of the poor as well as to the claims of the
rich. The whole popular movement suffers, for it is
degraded from its true position. From being a demand
for justice, it becomes a scramble for power&mdash;power too
which, when gained, is sometimes used as selfishly and
tyrannically by its new possessors as it sometimes was
by those who previously exercised it. Into all branches
of public life there is needed an infusion of a new and
higher spirit. We want men who hate evil and will
destroy it where they can, who seek nothing for themselves,
who feel strongly that the kind of life the poor
in civilised countries live is intolerably hard, and are
prepared to suffer, if by any means they may improve it.
But we want at the same time a type of reformer who,
by his hold upon a power lying beyond this world, is
kept steady to justice even where the poor are concerned,
who, though he passionately longs for a better life
for them, does not make more food, more leisure, more
amusement, his highest aim. Men are needed who think
more nobly of their brethren than that: men, on the
one hand, who know that the Christian character and
the Christian virtues may exist under the hardest conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and that the Christian Church exists mainly to
brighten and rob of its degradation the otherwise cheerless
life of the multitude; but, on the other, who recognise
that our present social state is fatal in many ways to
moral and spiritual progress for the mass of men, and
must be in some way recast.</p>

<p>All this means the entrance into public life of Christian
men of the highest type. Such men the Christian
community must supply to the State in great numbers,
if the higher characteristics of our people are not to be
lost. Through a long and eventful history, by the manifold
training afforded by religion and experience, the
English nation has become strong, patient, hopeful, and
self-reliant, with an instinct for justice and a hatred of
violence which cannot easily be paralleled. It has, too,
retained a faith in and respect for religion which many
other nations seem to have lost. That character is its
highest achievement, and its decay would be deplorable.
Christianity is specially called to help to preserve it, by
bringing to its aid the power of its own special character,
with its great spiritual resources. The sources of its
life are hid, and must be kept pure; the power of its
life must be made manifest in actual union with the higher
elements in the national character for mutual defence.
Above all, Christianity must not, timidly or sluggishly,
draw upon itself the curse of Meroz by not coming to
the help of the Lord against the mighty. Nor can it
permit the immediate interests of the respectable to blind
or hold it back. That which is best in its own nature
demands all this; and in seeking to answer that demand
the Churches will attain to a quite new life and power.
The Lord their God will be in the midst of them, and
they will feel it; for they will then have made themselves
channels for the Divine purity and power.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><i>THE BREAD OF THE SOUL</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> viii.</h4>


<p>In the chapters which follow, viz. viii., ix., and x. 1-11,
we have an appeal to history as a motive for fulfilling
the fundamental duty of loving God and keeping His
commandments. In its main points it is substantially
the same appeal which is made in chapters i.-iii., is,
in fact, a continuation of it. Its main characteristics,
therefore, have already been dealt with; but there are
details here which deserve more minute study. Coming
after Yahweh's great demand for the love of His people,
the references to the Divine action in the past assume
a deeper and more affectionate character than when they
were mere general exhortations to obedience and submission.
They become inducements to the highest efforts
of love; and the first appeal is naturally made to the
gracious and fatherly dealing of Yahweh with His people
in their journey through the wilderness. Of all the traditions
or reminiscences of Israel, this of the wilderness was
the most constantly present to the popular mind, and it
is always referred to as the most certain, the most impressive,
and the most touching of all Israel's historic experiences.
Yet Stade and others push the whole episode
aside, saying, if any Israelites came out of Egypt, we do
not know who they were. Such a mode of dealing with
clear, coherent, and in themselves not improbable historical
memories, is too arbitrary to have much effect, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the wilderness journey remains, and is likely to remain,
one of the indubitable facts which modern critical research
has established rather than shaken.</p>

<p>To this, then, our author turns, and he deals with it
in a somewhat unusual way. As we have seen, the
prevalent notion that piety and righteousness are rewarded
with material prosperity is firmly rooted in his mind.
But he did not feel himself limited to that as the
solitary right way of regarding the providence of God.
Men's minds are never quite so simple and direct in
their action as many students and critics are tempted
to suppose. Every great conception which holds the
minds of men produces its effects, even from the first
moment it is grasped, by <em>all</em> that is in it. Implications
and developments which are made explicit, or are called
out into visibility, only by the friction of new environments,
have been there from the beginning; and minds
have been secretly moulded by them though they were
not conscious of them. Hard and fast lines, then, are not
to be drawn between the stages of a great development, so
that one should say that before such and such a moment,
when a new aspect of the old truth has emerged into consciousness,
that aspect was not effective in any wise.
The outburst of waters from a reservoir is indubitable
evidence of steady persistent pressure from within in that
direction before the overflow. Similarly, in the region
of thought and feeling the emergence of a new aspect
of truth is of itself a proof that the holders of the root
conception were already swayed in that direction.</p>

<p>The history of Christianity affords proof of this. It
is a commonplace to-day that the world is only beginning
to do justice to some aspects of the teaching of our
Lord. But the teaching, always present, always exerted
its influence, and was felt before it could be explained. In
the Old Testament development the same thing was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
emphatically true. Individual responsibility to God was
not, so far as we can now see, distinctly present in
Israelite religious thought till the time of Jeremiah, but
it would be absurd to say that any mind that accepted
the religion of Yahweh had ever been without that feeling.
So with the doctrine of God's providence over men: we
are not to say that before the Book of Job the explanation
of suffering as testing discipline had been entirely hid
from Israel, by the view that material prosperity and
adversity were regulated in the main according to moral
and religious life. Consequently, notwithstanding previous
strong assertions of the latter view which we find in
Deuteronomy, we need not be in the least surprised to
find that here the hardships of the wilderness journey are
regarded, not as a punishment for Israel's sins, but simply
as a trial or test to see what their heart was towards
Him. This is essentially the point of view of the Book
of Job, the only difference being that here it is applied
to the nation, there to the individual. But our chapter
rises even above that, for the first verses of it plainly
teach that the experiences of the wilderness were
made to be what they were, in order that the people
might learn to know the spiritual forces of the world to
be the essential forces, and that they might be induced
to throw themselves back upon them as that which is
alone enduring. In the words of ver. 3, they were taught
by this training that man does not live by bread alone,
but by everything that proceeds from the mouth of God.</p>

<p>These two then, that hardship was testing discipline
for Israel, and that it was also intended to be the means
of revealing spirit as the supreme force even in the
material world, are the main lessons of the eighth chapter.
Of these the last is by far the most important. Casting
back his eye upon the past, the author of Deuteronomy
teaches that the trials and the victories, the wonders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the terrors of their wilderness time were meant to humble
them, to empty them of their own conceits, and to make
them know beyond all doubting that God alone was their
portion, and that apart from Him they had no certainty
of continuance in the future and no sustainment in the
present. "All the commandment which I command thee
this day shall ye observe to do, <em>that ye may live</em>," is the
fundamental note, and the physical needs and trials of the
time are cited as an object-lesson to that effect. "He
humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
with manna which thou knewest not; that He might make
thee to know that man doth not live by bread alone, but
by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Yahweh
doth man live." Of course the first reference of the
"everything that proceedeth" is to the creative word of
Yahweh. The meaning is that the sending of the manna
was proof that the ordinary means of living, <i>i.e.</i> bread,
could be dispensed with when Yahweh chose to make
use of His creative power. Many commentators think
that this exhausts the meaning of the passage, and they
regard our Lord's use of these words in the Temptation
as limited in the same fashion. But both here and in the
New Testament more must be intended. Here we have
the statement in the first verse that Israel is to keep the
commandments, which certainly are a part of "all that
proceeds" from the mouth of God, that they may <em>live</em>.
This implies that the mere possession of material sustenance
is not enough for even earthly life. Impalpable
spiritual elements must be mingled with "bread" if life
is not to decay. This, our chapter goes on to say, would
be plain to them if they would carefully consider God's
dealing with them in the wilderness, for the sending of
the manna was meant to emphasise and bring home to
them that very truth. It was meant, in short, to convey
a double lesson&mdash;the direct one above referred to, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
more remote but deeper one which had been asserted in
the first verse.</p>

<p>In the Temptation narrative the same deeper meaning
is surely implied. The temptation suggested to Jesus
was that He should use the miraculous powers given to
Him for special purposes to make stones into bread for
Himself. Now that would have been precisely an instance
of the literal primary meaning of our passage; it would
have been a case of supplying the absence of bread by the
use of the creative word of God. To meet that temptation
and to put it aside our Lord uses these words: "It is
written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." Thereupon
He was no more importuned to supply the place of
bread by a creative word. The implication is that the
life of the Son of God found sustenance in spiritual
strength derived from His Father. In other words, the
passage is really parallel to John iv. 31 ff: "In the
mean while the disciples prayed Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
But He said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know
not. The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath
any man brought Him to eat? Jesus saith unto them, My
meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to accomplish
His work." Understanding it thus, the Temptation
passage is entirely in accord with that from which it is
quoted, if the first and third verses be taken together.
Both teach that abundance of material resources, all that
visibly sustains the material life, is not sufficient for the
life of such a creature as man. Not only his inner life,
but his outer life, is dependent for its permanence upon
the inflow of spiritual sustenance from the spiritual God.
For animals, bread might be enough; but man holds of
both the spiritual and the material as animals do not.
It is not mere mythical dreaming when man is said to be
made in the image of God; it expresses the essential fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of his being. Consequently, without inbreathings from the
spiritual, even his physical life pines and dies. But how
wonderful is this insight in a writer so ancient, belonging
to so obscure a people as the Jews! How can we account
for it? There was nothing in their character or destiny
as a people to explain it, apart from the supernatural link
that binds them and their thoughts at all times to the
coming Christ, and draws them, notwithstanding all
aberrations, even when they know it not, towards
Him.</p>

<p>How great an attainment it is we may see, if we reflect
for a moment upon the state of Christian Europe at the
present day. Nowhere among the masses of the most
cultured nations is this deeply simple truth accepted by
the vast majority of men. Nowhere do we find that
history has succeeded in bringing it home to the conscience
as a commonplace. The rich or well-to-do cling to riches,
the means of material enjoyment, as if their life did consist
in the abundance of things they possess. They strive and
struggle for them with an industry, a forethought, a
perseverance, which would be justified only if man could
live by bread alone. That is largely the condition of those
who have bread in abundance or hope to gain it abundantly.
With those who do not have it the case is perhaps
even worse. Worn and fretted by the hopeless struggle
against poverty, driven wild by the exigencies of a daily
life so near starvation point that a strike, a fall in prices, a
month's sickness, bring them face to face with misery, the
toiling masses in Europe have turned with a kind of wolfish
impatience upon those who talk of God to them, and
demand "bread." As a German Socialist mother said
publicly some years ago, "He has never given me a
mouthful of bread, or means to gain it: what have I to do
with your God?" Their only hope for the future is that
they may eat and be full; and of this they have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a political and religious ideal which is attracting the
European working classes with most portentous power.</p>

<p>In all countries men are passionately asserting that
man <em>can</em> live by bread alone, and that he will. For this
dreadful creed increasing numbers are prepared to sacrifice
all that humanity thought it had gained, and shut their
ears to any who warn them that, if they had all they seek,
earth might be still more of a Pandemonium than they
think it at present. But they have much excuse. They
have never had wealth so as to know how very little it
can do for the deepest needs of men; and their faith in it,
their belief that if they were assured of a comfortable
maintenance all would be right with the world, is pathetic
in its simplicity. Yet the secret that is hid to-day from
the mass of men was known among the small Israelite
people two thousand five hundred years ago. Since then
it has formed the very keynote of the teaching of our
Lord; but save by the generations of Christians who have
found in it the key to much of the riddle of the world
it has been learned by nobody.</p>

<p>Yet history has never wearied in proclaiming the same
truth. Israel as we have seen, had verified it in the
history of the pre-Canaanite races whose disappearance is
recorded in the first section of our book, and in the doom
which was impending over the Canaanites. But to our
wider experience, enriched by the changes of more than
two thousand years, and by the still more striking
vicissitudes of ancient days revealed by arch√¶ology, the
fact that intelligence of the highest kind, practical skill,
and the courage of conquerors cannot secure "life," is
only more impressively brought home. If we go back to
the pre-Semitic empire of Mesopotamia, to what is called
the Akkadian time, we find that, before the days of
Abraham, a great civilisation had arisen, flourished for
more than one thousand years, and then decayed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
utterly that the very language in which its records were
written had to be dealt with by the Semites, who inherited
the former culture, as we deal with Latin. Yet these
early people had made a most astonishing advance into
the ocean of unknown truth. They had invented writing;
they had elaborate systems of law and social life; they
had in other directions made remarkable discoveries in
science, especially in mathematical and astronomical
science, and had built great cities in which the refinement
and art of modern times was in many directions anticipated.
In all ways they stood far higher above neighbouring
peoples than any civilised nation of Europe stands now
in comparison with its neighbours. But if they were at
all inclined to put their trust in the immortality of science,
if they ever valued themselves, as we do, on the strength
of the advances they had made, time has had them in
derision. Very much of what they knew had to be rediscovered
painfully in later times. Their very name
perished out of the earth; and it has been discovered
now to make them an object of abiding interest only to
the few who make ethnology their study. Neither
material wealth and comfort nor assiduous culture of
the mind could save them. For their religion and morals
were, amid all this material success, of the lowest type.
They heard little of what issues from the mouth of God
in the specially Divine sphere of morality, and did not give
heed to that little, and they perished. For man does
not live by bread alone, but by that also, and neglect
of it is fatal.</p>

<p>It may be said that they flourished for more than a
thousand years, and neglect of the Divine word, if it be
a poison, must (as F√©n√©lon said of coffee) be a very slow
one, so far as nations are concerned. But it has always
been a snare to men to mistake the Divine patience for
Divine indifference and inaction. The movement, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to us creatures of a day it seems slow, is as continuous, as
crushing, and as relentless as the movement of a glacier.
"The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding
small," and all along the ages they have thrown out the
crushed and scattered fragments of the powers that were
deaf to the Divine voice. So persistently has this appeared
that it would by this time have passed beyond the region
of faith into that of sight, were it not always possible to
ignore the moral cause and substitute for it something
mechanical and secondary. The great world-empires of
Egypt and Assyria passed away, primarily owing to neglect
of the higher life. Secondarily, no doubt, the ebbs and
flows of their power, and their final extinction, were influenced
by the course of the Indian trade; and many wise
men think they do well to stop there. But in truth we
do not solve the difficulty by resting in this secondary
cause; we only shift it a step backwards. For the
question immediately arises, Why did the trade change
its course from Assyria to Egypt, and back again from
Egypt to Assyria? Why did a rivulet of it flow through
the land of Israel in Solomon's day and afterwards cease?
The answer must be that it was when the character of
these various nations rose in vigour by foresight and
moral self-restraint that they drew to themselves this
source of power. They "lived," in fact, by giving heed
to some word of God. Nor does the history of Greek
supremacy in Europe and Asia, or the rise and fall of
the Roman Empire, contradict that view. The modern
historian, whatever his faith or unfaith may be, is driven
to find the motive power which wrought in these stupendous
movements in the moral and spiritual sphere. This
transforms history from being merely secular into a Bible,
as Mommsen finely says,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> "And if she cannot any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
than the Bible hinder the fool from misunderstanding and
the devil from quoting her, she too will be able to bear
with and to requite them both." She utters her voice in
the streets, and in the end makes her meaning clear. For
she gives us ever new examples.</p>

<p>Probably her grandest object-lesson at present is the
wasting and paralysis that is slowly withering up all
Mohammedan states. Where they have been left to
themselves, as in Morocco and Persia, depopulation and
the break-up of society has come upon them, and where
Muslim populations are really prospering it is under the
influence of Christian Powers. And the reason is plain.
Islam is a revolt from, and a rejection of, the higher
principles of life contained in Christianity, and a return
to Judaism. But the Judaism to which it returned had
already lost its finest bloom. All that was left to it of
tenderness or power of expansion Islam rejected, and of
the driest husks of Old Testament religion it made its
sole food. Naturally and necessarily, therefore, it has
been found inadequate. It cannot permanently live under
present conditions, and it is capable of no renewal. Here
and there, especially in India, attempts to break out of
the prison house which this system builds around its
votaries are being made, but in the opinion of experts
like Mr. Sell<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> they cannot succeed. "Such a movement,"
he tells us, "may elevate individuals and purify the
family life of many, but it will, like all reform movements
of the past, have very little real effect on Islam as a
polity and as a religion." If he be right, we learn from a
Mohammedan whom he quotes, the Naual Mulisin-ul-Mulk,
what alone can be looked for. "To me it seems," he says,
"that as a nation and a religion we are dying out; our
day is past, and we have little hope of the future." More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
conspicuously and deliberately perhaps than any one did
Mohammed choose to go back from the best light that
shone in the world of his day. Some at least of his contemporaries
knew what a spiritual religion meant. He
was guilty, therefore, of the "great refusal"; and his work,
great as it was, seems to some even of his own disciples
to be hastening to its end. Material success, bread in all
senses, the kingdoms founded by him and his successors
had in abundance, and still might have. But man cannot
live by that alone, and the absence of the higher element
has taken even that away.</p>

<p>In Christendom, too, the same lesson is being taught.
Of all European countries France perhaps is that where
the corroding power of materialistic thought has been most
severely felt. Yet few countries are so rich in material
wealth, and if bread was all that "life" demanded, no
country should be so full of it. But it is in no sense so.
Even its intellectual life is drooping, and its population,
if not decreasing, is standing still. This, all serious
writers deplore; and the dawn of what may perhaps be a
new era is seen in the earnestness with which the sources
of this evil are sought out and discussed. Men like the
Vicomte de Vog√º√©<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> depict the new generation as weary
of negations, sick of the material positivism of their
immediate predecessors, disgusted with "realism," which,
as another recent writer defines it, "in thought is mere
provincialism, in affection absolute egoism, in politics the
deification of brute force; in the higher grades of society
tyranny; in the lower, unbridled licence." And the only
cure is faith and moral idealism. "Society can apply
to itself to-day," says De Vog√º√©, "the beautiful image of
Plotinus; it resembles those travellers lost in the night,
seated in silence on the shore of the sea, waiting for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
sun to rise above the billows." In Germany similar
conditions have produced similar though much mitigated
results. Yet even there, Lange, the historian of
materialism, tells us that there runs through all our modern
culture a tendency to materialism, which carries away
every one who has not found somewhere a sure anchor.
"The ideal has no currency; all that cannot prove its
claim on the basis of natural science and history is
condemned to destruction, though a thousand joys and
refreshments of the masses depend upon it." He concludes
by saying that "ideas and sacrifices may still save
our civilisation, and change the path of destructive
revolution into a path of beneficent reforms." Through
all history, then, and loudest in our own day, the cry of
our passage goes up; and where the path marked out by
the faith of Israel, and carried to its goal by Jesus Christ,
has been forsaken, the peoples are resting in hungry
expectation. Words from the mouth of God can alone
save them; and if the Churches cannot make them hear,
and no new voice brings it home to them, there would
seem to be nothing before them but a slower or quicker
descent into death.</p>

<p>But it may be that the nations are deaf to the Churches'
voice because these have not learned thoroughly that life
for them too is conditioned in the same fashion. They
can live truly, fully, triumphantly only when they take up
and absorb "everything that issues from the mouth of God."
All Christians must admit this; but most proceed at once
to annul what they have stated by the limitations of
meaning they impose upon it. An older generation
vehemently affirmed this faith, meaning by it every word
and letter which Scripture contained. We do not find
fault with what they assert, for the first necessity of
spiritual life is the study and love of the Holy Scriptures.
No one who knows what the higher life in Christ is, needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to be told that the very bread of life is in the Bible.
Neglect it, or, what is perhaps worse, study it only from
the scientific and intellectual point of view, and life will
slowly ebb away from you, and your religion will bring
you none of the joy of living. Bring your thoughts, your
hopes, your fears, and your aspirations into daily contact
with it, and you will feel a vigour in your spiritual nature
which will make you "lords over circumstance." Every
part of it contributes to this effect when it is properly
understood, for experience proves the vanity of the
attempt to distinguish between the Bible and the word of
God. As it stands, wrought into one whole by labours
the strenuousness, the multiplicity, the skill, and the religious
spirit of which we are only now coming to understand,
it is the word of God; it has issued from His mouth,
and from it, searched out and understood, the most satisfying
"bread" of the soul must come. Only by use of it can
the Christian soul live. But though the Bible is the
word of God <i>par excellence</i>, it is not the only word that
issues from the mouth of God to man. Because the
Church has often too much refused to listen to any other
word of God, those who are without are "sitting looking
out over the sea towards the west for the rising of the sun
which is behind them." For if it is death to the spirit to
turn away from Scripture, it means sickness and disease
to refuse to learn the other lessons which are set for us
by the God of truth. All true science must contain a
revelation of Him, for it is an exposition of the manner of
His working. History too is a Bible, which has been confirming
with trumpet tongue the truths of Scripture as we
have seen. Nay, it is a commentary upon the special
revelation given to us through Israel, set for our study by
the Author of that revelation. Further, we may say that
the progress of our Christian centuries has shown us
heights and depths of wisdom in the revelation mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
has received in Christ which, without its light, we should
not have known.</p>

<p>The spirit of Christ in regard to slavery, for instance,
was made manifest fully only in our day. The true
relations of men to each other, as conceived by our
blessed Lord, are evidently about to be forced home upon
the world by the turmoils, the strikes, and the outrages,
by the wild demands, and the wilder hopes which are the
characteristic of our epoch. In the future, too, there
must lie experiences which will make manifest to men the
brand which the spirit of Christ puts upon war, with its
savagery and its folly. These are only noteworthy
instances of the explanation of revelation by the developments
of the Divine purpose in the world. But in countless
ways the same process is going on, and the Church
which refuses to regard it is preparing a decay of its own
life. For man lives by <em>every</em> word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God, and every such word missed means a
loss of vitality. The Christian Church, therefore, if it is
to be true to its calling, should be seriously watchful lest
any Divinely sent experience should be lost to it. It
cannot be indifferent, much less hostile, to discoveries in
physical science; it cannot ignore any fact or lesson
which history reveals; it cannot sit apart from social
experiments, as if holding no form of creed in such things,
without seriously impairing its chances of life. For all
these things are pregnant with most precious indications
of the mind of God, and to turn from them is to sit in
darkness and the shadow of death. In the most subtle
and multifarious way, the inner spiritual life of man is
being modified by the discoveries of scientists, historians,
philologists, arch√¶ologists, and critics, and by the new
attention which is being given to the foundations of society
and social life. All the truth that is in these discoveries
issues from the mouth of God. They too are a Bible, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Mommsen says, and if the Christian Church cannot "hinder
the fool from misunderstanding and the devil from quoting
them," it can itself listen with open ear to these teachings,
and work them into coherent unity with the great spiritual
Revelation. This is the perennial task which awaits the
Church at every stage of its career, for on no other terms
can it live a healthy life.</p>

<p>Here we find the answer to timid Christians who address
petulant complaints to those who are called to attempt
this work. If, say they, these new thoughts are not
essential to faith, if in the forms to which we have been
accustomed the essence of true religion has been preserved,
why do you disturb the minds of believers by outside
questions? The reply is that we dare not refuse the
teaching which God is sending us in these ways. To
refuse light is to blaspheme light. Though we might
save our generation some trouble by turning our back
upon this light, though we might even save some from
manifest shipwreck of faith, we should pay for that by
sacrificing all the future, and by rendering faith impossible
perhaps for greater multitudes of our successors.</p>

<p>Yet this does not imply that the Church is to be driven
about by every wind of doctrine. Some men of science
demand, apparently, that every new discovery, in its first
crude form, should be at once adopted by the Church, and
that all the inferences unfavourable to received views
of religion, which occur to men accustomed to think
only truths that can be demonstrated by experiment,
should be registered in its teachings. But such a demand
is mere folly. The Church has in its possession a body
of truth which, if not verifiable by experiment, has been
verified by experience as no other body of truth has been.
Even its enemies being judges, no other system of a moral
or spiritual kind has risen above the horizon which can
for a moment be compared with Christianity as the guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of men for life and death.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Through all changes of secular
thought, and amid all the lessons which the world has
taught the Church, the fundamental doctrines have
remained in essence the same, and by them the whole
life of man, social, political, and scientific, has ultimately
been guided. Immense practical interests have therefore
been committed to the Church's keeping, the interests
primarily of the poor and the obscure. She ought never
to be tempted, consequently, to think that she is moving
and acting in a vacuum, or manage her affairs after the
manner of a debating society. It is no doubt a fault to
move too slowly; but in circumstances like that of the
Church, it can never be so destructive to the best interests
of mankind as to move with wanton instability. Her true
attitude must be to prohibit no lines of inquiry, to open
her mind seriously to all the demonstrated truths of science
with gladness, to be tolerant of all loyal effort to reform
Christian thought in accordance with the new light, when
that has become at all possible. For her true food is
everything that issues from the mouth of God; and only
when she receives with gratitude her daily bread in this
way also, can her life be as vigorous and as elevated as
it ought to be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><i>ISRAEL'S ELECTION, AND MOTIVES FOR FAITHFULNESS</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> ix-xi.</h4>


<p>The remaining chapters of this special introduction
to the statement of the actual laws beginning with
chapter xii., contain also an earnest insistence upon other
motives why Israel should remain true to the covenant
of Yahweh. They are urged to this, not only because
life both spiritual and physical depended upon it, as was
shown in the trials of the wilderness, but they are also to
lay it to heart that in the conquests which assuredly await
them, it will be Yahweh alone to whom they will owe
them. The spies had declared, and the people had
accepted their report, that these peoples were far mightier
than they, and that no one could stand before the children
of Anak. But the victory over them would show that
Yahweh had been among them like a consuming fire,
before which the Canaanite power would wither as brushwood
in the flame.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the thought would obviously
lie near that, as they had been defeated and driven back
in their first attempt upon Canaan because of their unrighteousness
and unbelief, so they would conquer now
because of their righteousness and obedience. But this
thought is sternly repressed. The fundamental doctrine
which is here insisted on is that Israel's consciousness
of being the people of God must at the same time be a
consciousness of complete dependence upon Him. If His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
gifts were ultimately to be the reward of human righteousness,
then obviously that feeling of complete dependence
could not be established. They are to move so completely
in the shadow of God that they are to see in their
successes only the carrying out of the Divine purposes.
Instead of feeling fiercely contemptuous of the Canaanites
they destroy, because they stand on a moral and spiritual
height which gives them a right to triumph, the Israelites
are to feel that, while it is for wickedness that the Canaanite
people are to be punished, they themselves had not been
free from wickedness of an aggravated kind. Their
different treatment, therefore, rests upon the fact that
they are to be Yahweh's chosen instruments. In the
patriarchs he chose them to become the means, the
vehicle, by which salvation and blessing were to be brought
to all nations. While, therefore, the evil that comes upon
the peoples they are to conquer is deserved, the good
they themselves are to receive is equally undeserved.
That which alone accounts for the difference is the faithfulness
of God to the promises He made for the sake of
His purposes. He needs an instrument through which
to bless mankind. He has chosen Israel for this purpose,
partly doubtless because of some qualities, not necessarily
spiritual or moral, which they have come to have, and
partly because of their historical position in the world.
These taken together make them at this precise moment
in the history of the world's development the fittest
instruments to carry out the Divine purpose of love to
mankind. And they are elected, made to enter into more
constant and intimate communion with God than other
nations, on that account. In the words of Rothe, "God
chooses or elects at each historical moment from the
totality of the sinful race of mankind that nation by
whose enrolment among the positive forces which are to
develop the kingdom of God the greatest possible advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
towards the complete realisation of it may be attained,
under the historical circumstances of that moment."
Whether that completely covers the individual election
of St. Paul, as Rothe thinks, or not, it certainly precisely
expresses the national election of the Old Testament, and
exhausts the meaning of our passage. Israelite particularism
had universality of the highest kind as its background,
and here the latter comes most insistently to its
rights.</p>

<p>It was not only the election of Israel to be a peculiar
people which depended upon the wise and loving purpose
of God; the providences which befell them also had that
as their source. To fit them for their mission, and to
give them a place wherein they could develop the germs
of higher faith and nobler morality which they had received,
Yahweh gave them victory over those greater nations,
and planted them in their place. This, and this only,
was the reason of their success; and with scathing irony
the author of Deuteronomy stamps under his feet (ix. 7 ff.)
any claim to superior righteousness on their part. He
points back to their continuous rebellions during the forty
years in the wilderness. From the beginning to the end
of their journey towards the promised land, they are
told, they have been rebellious and stiff-necked and unprofitable.
They have broken their covenant with their
God. They have caused Moses to break the tables of
stone containing the fundamental conditions of the covenant,
because their conduct had made it plain that they had not
seriously bound themselves to it. But the mercy of God
had been with them. Notwithstanding their sin, Yahweh
had been turned to mercy by the prayer of Moses (vv. 25 ff.),
and had repented of His design to destroy them. A new
covenant was entered into with them (chap. x.) by means
of the second tables, which contained the same commands
as were engraven on the first. The renewal, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
was ratified by the separation of the tribe of Levi (x.
8 ff.) to be the specially priestly tribe, "to bear the
Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before the
Lord to minister unto Him and to bless in His name."
From beginning to end it was always Yahweh, and again
Yahweh, who had chosen and loved and cared for them.
It was He who had forgiven and strengthened them; but
always for reasons which reached far beyond, or even
excluded, any merit on their part.</p>

<p>The grounds of Moses' successful intercession for them
(ix. 25 ff.) are notable in this connection. They have no
reference at all to the needs, or hopes, or expectations of
the people. These are all brushed aside, as being of no
moment after such unfaithfulness as theirs had been.
The great object before his mind is represented to be
Yahweh's glory. If this stiff-necked people perish, then
the greatness of God will be obscured and His purposes
will be misunderstood. Men will certainly think, either
that Yahweh, Israel's God, attempted to do what He was
not able to do, or that He was wroth with His people,
and drew them out into the wilderness to slay them there.
It is God's purpose with them, God's purpose for the
world through them, which alone gives them importance.
Were it not for that, they would be as little worth
saving as they have deserved to be saved. For his
people, and, we may be sure, for himself, Moses recognises
no true worth save in so far as he or they were useful in
carrying out Divine purposes of good to the world. Nor
is the absence of any plea on Israel's behalf, that it is
miserable or unhappy, due merely to a desire to keep the
rebellious people in the background for the moment, and
to appeal only to the Divine self-love for a pardon which
would, on the merits of the case, be refused. It is the
God of the whole earth, before whom "the inhabitants
of the earth are as grasshoppers," who is appealed to;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a God removed far above the petty motives of self-interested
men, and set upon the one great purpose of
establishing a kingdom of God upon the earth into which
all nations might come. If His glory is appealed to, that
is only because it is the glory of the highest good both
for the individual and for the world. If fear lest doubt
should be cast upon His power is put forward as a reason
for His having mercy, that is because to doubt His power
is to doubt the supremacy of goodness. If the Divine
promise to the patriarchs is set forth here, it is because
that promise was the assurance of the Divine interest in
and Divine love of the world.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it would need a very narrow-hearted
literalism, such as only very "liberal" theologians
and critics could favour, to reduce this appeal to a mere
attempt to flatter Yahweh into good-humour. It really
embodies all that can be said in justification of our looking
for answers to prayer at all; and rightly understood it
limits the field of the answer as strictly as the expressed
or implied limitations of the New Testament, viz. that
effectual prayer can only be for things according to the
will of God. Moreover it expresses an entirely natural
attitude towards God. Before Him, the sum of all
perfections, the loving and omniscient and omnipresent
God, what is man that he should assert himself in
any wise? When the height and the depth, the
sublimity and the comprehensiveness of the Divine
purpose is considered, how can a man do aught save fall
upon his face in utter self-forgetfulness, immeasurably
better even than self-contempt? The best and holiest
of mankind have always felt this most; and the habit of
measuring their attainments by the faithfulness and
knowledge, the virtue and power which is in God, has
impressed some of the greatest minds and purest souls
with such humility, that to men without insight it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
seemed mere affectation. But the pity, the condescension,
the love of Christ has so brought God down into our
human life, that we are apt at times to lose our awe of
God as seen in Him. Were we children of the spirit we
should not fall into that sin. We cannot, consequently,
be too frequently or too sharply recalled to the more
austere and remote standpoint of the Old Testament.
For many even of the most pious it would be well if they
could receive and keep a more just impression of their
own worthlessness and nullity before God.</p>

<p>In the section from the twelfth verse of chapter x. to
the end of chapter xi. the hortatory introduction is summed
up in a final review of all the motives to and the results
of obedience and love to God. The fundamental exhortation
as to love to God is once more repeated; only
here fear is joined with love and precedes it; but the
necessity of love to God is expanded and dwelt upon, as
at the beginning, with a zeal that never wearies. The
Deuteronomist illustrates and enforces it with old reasons
and new, always speaking with the same pleading and
heartfelt earnestness. He does not fear the tedium of
repetition, nor the accusation of moving in a narrow
round of ideas. Evidently in the evil time when he
wrote this love towards God had come to be his own
support and his consolation; and it had been revealed
to him as the source of a power, a sweetness, and a
righteousness which could alone bring the nation into
communion with God. In affecting words resembling
very closely the noble exhortation in Micah vi., "He
hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
Yahweh require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" he teaches
much the same doctrine as his contemporary: "And now,
Israel, what doth Yahweh thy God require of thee, but
to fear Yahweh thy God, to walk in all His ways, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to love Him, and to serve Yahweh thy God with all thy
heart and with all thy soul, to keep the commandments
of Yahweh and His statutes which I command thee this
day for thy good?"<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>In spirit these passages seem identical; but it is held
by many writers on the Old Testament that they are
not so, that they represent, in fact, opposite poles of the
faith and life of Israel. Micah is supposed by Duhm, for
instance, to mean by his threefold demand that justice
between man and man, love and kindliness and mercy
towards others, and humble intercourse with God are,
in <em>distinction from sacrifice</em>, true religion and undefiled.
Robertson Smith also considers that these verses in
Micah contain a repudiation of sacrifice. In Deuteronomy,
on the contrary, fear and love of God and walking in His
ways are placed first, but they are joined with a demand
for the heartfelt service of God and the keeping of His
statutes as about to be set forth. Now these certainly
include ritual and sacrifice. The one passage, written by
a prophet, excludes sacrifice as binding and acceptable
service of God; the other, written perhaps by a priest,
certainly by a man upon whom no prophetic lessons of
the past had been lost, includes it. To use the words of
Robertson Smith in discussing the requisites of forgiveness
in the Old Testament, "According to the prophets Yahweh
asks only a penitent heart and desires no sacrifice;
according to the ritual law, He desires a penitent heart
approaching Him in certain sacrificial sacraments."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The
author of Deuteronomy teaches the second view; the
author of Micah chap. vi., who is probably his contemporary,
teaches the former. How is such divergence
accounted for? The answer generally made is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Deuteronomy was the product of a close alliance between
priests and prophets. A common hatred of Manasseh's
idolatry and a common oppression had brought them
together as never perhaps before. With one heart and
mind they wrought in secret for the better day which they
saw approaching, and Deuteronomy was a reissue of the
ancient Mosaic law adapted to the prophetic teaching.
It represented a compromise between, or an amalgamation
of, two entirely distinct positions.</p>

<p>But even on this view it would follow that from the
time of Josiah, when Deuteronomy was accepted as the
completest expression of the will of God, the doctrine that
ritual and sacrifice as well as penitence were essential
things in true religion was known, and not only known
but accepted as the orthodox opinion. Putting aside, then,
the question whether sacrifice was acknowledged by the
prophets before this or not, they must have accepted it from
this point onward, unless they denied to Deuteronomy
the authority which it claimed and which the nation conceded
to it. Jeremiah clearly must have assented to it, for
his style and his thought have been so closely moulded on
this book that some have thought he may have been its
author. In any case he did not repudiate its authority;
and all the prophets who followed him must have known
of this view, and also that it had been sanctioned by that
book which was made the first Jewish Bible.</p>

<p>We have here, at all events, the keynote of the supremacy
of moral duty over Divine commands concerning
ritual which distinguishes the prophetic teaching in Micah
and elsewhere, joined with the enforcement of ritual observances.
But there are few purely prophetic passages which
raise the higher demand so high as it is raised here.</p>

<p>To love and fear God are anew declared to be man's
supreme duties, and the author presses these home by
arguments of various kinds. Again he returns to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
election of Israel by Yahweh, without merit of theirs;
and to bring home to them how much this means, the
Deuteronomist exhibits the greatness of their God, His
might, His justice, and His mercy, which, great as it
is to His chosen people, is not confined to them, but
extends to the stranger also. This most gracious One
they are to serve by deeds, to Him they are to cleave,
and they are to swear by Him only, that is, they are
solemnly to acknowledge Him to be their God in return
for His undeserved favour. For their very existence as a
nation is a wonder of His power, since they were only
a handful when they went down to Egypt, and now were
"as the stars of heaven for multitude."</p>

<p>Then once more, in chapter xi., he repeats his one
haunting thought that love is to be the source of all
worthy fulfilment of the law; and he endeavours to shed
abroad this love to God in their hearts by reminding
them once more of all the marvels of their deliverance
from Egypt, and of their wilderness journey. Their God
had delivered them first, then chastised them for their
sins, and had trained them for the new life that awaited
them in the land promised to their fathers.</p>

<p>Even in the security of the land they were to find
themselves not less dependent upon God than before.
Rather their dependence would be more striking and more
impressive than in Egypt. As we have seen repeatedly,
this inspired writer belonged in many respects to the
childhood of the world, and the people he addressed were
primitive in their ideas. Yet his thoughts of God in their
highest flight were so essentially true and deep, that even
to-day we can go back upon them for edification and
inspiration. But here we have an appeal based upon a
distinction which to-day should have almost entirely lost
its meaning. The Deuteronomist yields quite simply and
unreservedly to the feeling that the regular, unvarying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
processes of nature are less Divine, or at least are less
immediately significant of the Divine presence, than those
which cannot be foreseen, which vary, and which defy
human analysis. For he here contrasts Egypt and Canaan,
in both of which he represents Israel as having been
engaged in agricultural pursuits, and speaks as if in the
former all depended upon human industry and ingenuity,
and might be counted upon irrespective of moral conduct,
while in the latter all would depend upon Divine favour
and a right attitude towards God. It is quite true that in
preceding chapters he has been teaching that, even for
worldly material success, the higher life is necessary, that
man nowhere lives by bread alone; and that we may
assuredly assume is his deepest, his ultimate thought. But
he has a practical end in view at this moment. He wishes
to persuade his people, and he appeals to what both he
and they felt, though in the last resort it might hardly
perhaps be justified. In Egypt, he says, your agricultural
success was certain if only you were industrious. The
great river, of which the land itself is the gift, came
down in flood year after year, and you had only to store
and to guide its waters to ensure you a certain return for
your labour. You had not to look to uncertain rains,
but could by diligence always secure a sufficiency of the
life-giving element. In Canaan it will not be so. It
"drinketh water only of the rain of heaven." God's
eye has to be upon it continually to keep it fertile, and
the sense of dependence upon Him will force itself upon
you more constantly and powerfully in consequence.
They could hope to prosper only if they never forgot,
never put away His exhortations out of their sight. Otherwise,
he says, the life-giving showers will not fall in their
due season. Your land will not yield its fruits, and "ye
shall perish quickly off the good land which Yahweh
giveth you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Now what are we to say of this appeal? There can be
no doubt that the Divine omnipotence was really, in the
Deuteronomist's view as well as in ours, as irresistible in
Egypt as in Canaan. Fundamentally, no doubt, life or
death, prosperity or adversity, were as much in the hand
of God in the one case as in the other; and the Deuteronomist,
at least, had no doubt that rebellion against God
could and would destroy Egypt's prosperity as much as
Canaan's. But he felt that somehow there was a tenderer
and more intimate communion of love between Yahweh
and His people under the one set of circumstances than
under the other. We are not entitled to impute to him a
questionable distinction which modern minds are apt to
make, viz. that where long experience has taught men to
regard the course of providence as fixed, there the sphere
of prayer for material benefit ends, and that only in the
region where the Divine action in nature seems to us
more spontaneous, and less capable of being foreseen,
can prayer be heartily, because hopefully, made. But
the feeling that suggests that was certainly in his mind.
He felt the difference between the fixed conditions of life
in Egypt and the more variable conditions in Canaan, to
be much the same as the difference between the circumstances
of a son receiving a fixed yearly allowance from
his father, in an independent and perhaps distant home,
and those of a son in his father's house, who receives his
portion day by day as the result and evidence of an ever-present
affection. Both are equally dependent upon the
father's love, and both should theoretically be equally
filled with loving gratitude. But as a fact, the latter
would be more likely to be so, and would be held more
guilty if he were not so. Upon that actual fact the
Deuteronomist takes his stand. As they were now to
enter into Yahweh's land, His chosen dwelling-place, he
sees in the different material conditions of the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
country that which should make the union between
Yahweh and His people more intimate and more secure,
and He presses home upon them the greater shame of
ingratitude, if under such circumstances they should
forget God and His laws.</p>

<p>Finally (xi. 22-25) he promises them the victorious
extension of their dominion if they will love Yahweh and
keep His laws. From Lebanon to the southern wilderness,
from the Euphrates to the western sea, they should rule,
if they would cleave unto their God. At no time was
this promise fulfilled save in the days of David and
Solomon. For only then had Lebanon and the wilderness,
the Euphrates and the sea, been the boundaries of Israel.
This must, then, be regarded as the time of Israel's
greatest faithfulness. But it is striking that it is in
Josiah's day, after the adoption of Deuteronomy as the
national law, that we meet with a conscious effort to
realise this condition of things once more. There would
seem to be little doubt that the good king took an equally
literal view of what the book commanded and of what it
promised. He inaugurated a period of complete external
compliance with the law, and like the young and inexperienced
man he was, he regarded that as the fulfilment
of its requirements, and looked for a similar instantaneous
fulfilment of the promises. Bit by bit he had absorbed
the ancient territory of the Northern Kingdom; and in the
decay of the Assyrian power he saw the opportunity for
the enlargement of his dominion to the limit here defined.
He consequently went out against Pharaoh Necho in the
full confidence that he would be victorious. But if the
Divine promise and its conditions were taken up too
superficially by him, Divine providence soon and terribly
corrected the error. The defeat and death of Josiah
revealed that the reformation had not been real and deep
enough, and that the nation was not faithful enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
make such triumph possible. Indeed, so far as we can
see, the time for any true fulfilment of Israel's calling
in that fashion had then passed by. The harvest was
past, and Israel was not saved, and could not now be
saved, for it was in its deepest heart unfaithful.</p>

<p>It may be questioned by some, of course, whether an
Israel faithful even in the highest degree could at any
time have kept possession of so wide a dominion in the
face of the great empires of Assyria and Egypt. These
were rich, and had a far larger command both of territory
and men: how then could the Israelites ever have maintained
themselves in face of them? But the question
is how to measure the power of the higher ideas they
held. It is not force but truth that rules the world; and
absolutely no limit can be set to the possibilities which
open out to a free, morally robust, and faithful people,
who have become possessed of higher spiritual ideas
than the peoples that surround them. Even in this
sceptical modern day the transformation as regards
physical strength which takes place when certain classes
of Hindus become either Mohammedans or Christians
is so startling and so rapid that it appears almost
a miracle. As regards courage, too, it is even more
rapid and equally remarkable. The great majority of
the struggles of nations are fought out on the level
of mere physical force and for material ends, and the
strongest and richest wins: but whenever a people possessed
of higher ideas and absolutely faithful to them
does appear, the opposing power, however great it may
be in wealth and numbers, is whirled away in fragments
as by a tornado, or it dissolves like ice before the sun.
What Israel might have been, therefore, had it been
penetrated by the principles of the higher religion, and
been passionately true to it, can in no way be judged
by that which it actually was. Among the untried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
possibilities which it was too unfaithful to realise, the
possession of such an empire as Deuteronomy promises
would seem to be one of the least.</p>

<p>Our chapter sums up what precedes with the declaration
on the part of Yahweh, "See, I am setting before you
this day a blessing and a curse," according as they might
obey or disobey the Divine command. It is stated, in
short, that the whole future of the people is to be determined
by their attitude to Yahweh and the commands He
has given them. In these two words "blessing" and
"curse," as Dillmann observes, He sets before them the
greatness of the decision they are called upon to make.
Just as at the end of chapter iii. the vision of Yahweh's
stretched-out hand, which has strewn the world with the
wrecks and fragments of destroyed nations, is relied on
to prepare the people for contemplating their own calling,
so here the gain or loss which would follow their decision
is solemnly set before them. By Dillmann and others
it is supposed that vv. 29 and 31, which instruct the
people to "lay the blessing upon Mount Gerizim and the
curse upon Mount Ebal," have been transferred by the
later editor from chapter xxvii., where they would come
in very fittingly after ver. 3. But whether that be so or
not, they are evidently so far in place here that they add
to the solemnity with which the fate of the nation in the
future is insisted upon. Their "choice is brief and yet
endless"; it can be made in a moment, but in its consequence
it will endure.</p>

<p>But here a difficulty arises. Dr. Driver in his <cite>Introduction</cite>
says of this hortatory section of our book that its
teaching is that "duties are not to be performed from
secondary motives, such as fear or dread of consequences;
they are to be the spontaneous outcome of a heart from
which every taint of worldliness has been removed, and
which is penetrated by an all-absorbing sense of personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
devotion to God." Yet in these later chapters we have
had little else but appeals to the gratitude and hopes and
fears of Israel. Chapters viii. to xi. are wholly taken up
with incitements to love and obey God, because He has
been immeasurably good to them, never letting their
ingratitude overcome His lovingkindness; because they
are wholly dependent upon Him for prosperity and the
fertility of their land; and because evil will come upon
them if they do not. That would seem to be the opposite
of what Driver has declared to be the informing spirit
and the fundamental teaching of Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>Yet his view is the true one. Even if the Deuteronomist
had added these lower motives to attract and gain over
those who were not so open to the higher, that would not
deprive him of the glory of having set forth disinterested
love as the really impelling power in true religion. We
are not required to lower our esteem of that achievement,
even if, like the reasonable and wise teacher he is, he
boldly uses every motive that actually influences men,
whether it should do so or not, to win them to the higher
life. But it is not necessary to suppose that he does so.
His demand is that men shall love Yahweh their God
with all their heart and strength, and to win them to
that he sets forth what their God has revealed Himself
to be. Men cannot love one whom they do not know;
they cannot love one who has not proved himself lovable
to them. As his whole effort is to get men to love God,
and show their love by obedience to His expressed will,
the Deuteronomist brings to mind all His loving thoughts
and acts towards them, and so continually keeps his appeal
at the highest level. He does not ask men to serve God
because it will be profitable to them, but because they
love God; and he endeavours to make them love God by
reciting all His love and friendliness and patience to His
people, and by pointing out the evil which His love is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
seeking to ward off. The plea is not the ignoble one that
they must serve Yahweh for what they can gain by it, but
that they should love Yahweh for His love and graciousness,
and that out of this love continual obedience should
flow as a necessary result. That is his central position;
and if he points out the necessary results of a refusal to
turn to God in this way, he does not thereby set forth
slavish fear or calculating prudence as in themselves
religious motives. They are only natural and reasonable
means of turning men to view the other side. He uses
them to bring the people to a pause, during which he
may win them by the love of God. That is always
the true appeal; and Christianity when it is at its finest
can do nothing but follow in this path. Having before
his mind the results of evil conduct, he does urge men to
escape from the wrath that may rest upon them. But the
only means so to escape is to yield to the love of God.
No self-restraint dictated by fear of consequences, no
turning from evil because of the lions that are seen in
the path, satisfies the demand of either Old Testament
or New Testament religion. Both raise the truly
religious life above that into the region of self-devoting
love; and they both deny spiritual validity to all acts,
however good they may be in themselves, which do
not follow love as its free and uncalculating expression.
Yet they both deal with men as rational beings who can
estimate the results of their acts, and warn them of the
death which must be the end of every other way of
supposed salvation. In this manner they keep the path
between extremes, ignoring neither the inner heart of
religion nor winding themselves too high for sinful men.</p>

<p>How hard it is to keep to this reasonable but spiritual
view is seen by popular aberrations both within and
without the Church. At times in the history of the
Church Christian teachers have allowed their minds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
be so dominated by the terror of judgment that judgment
has seemed to the world to be the sole burden of their
message. As a reaction from that again, other teachers
have arisen who put forward the love of God in such
a one-sided way as to empty it of all its severe but
glorious sublimity; as if, like Mohammed, they believed
God was minded mainly "to make religion easy" unto
men. Outside the Church the same discord prevails.
Some secular writers praise those religions which declare
that a man's fate is decided at the judgment by the balance
of merit over demerit in his acts; while others mock at
any judgment, and commit themselves with a light heart
to the half-amused tolerance of the Divine good-nature.
But the teaching which combines both elements can alone
sustain and bear up a worthy spiritual life. To rely upon
terror only, is to ignore the very essence of true religion
and the better elements in the nature of man; for that <em>will</em>
not be dominated by fear alone. To think of the Divine
love as a lazy, self-indulgent laxity, is to degrade the
Divine nature, and to forget that the possibility of wrath
is bound up in all love that is worthy of the name.</p>

<p>One other point is worthy of remark. In these chapters,
which deal with the history of God's chosen people in
their relations with Him, there come out the very elements
which distinguish the personal religion of St. Paul. The
beginning and end of it all is the free grace of God. God
elected His people that they might be His instrument for
blessing the world, not because of any goodness in them,
for they were perverse and rebellious, but because He
had so determined and had promised to the fathers. He
had delivered them from the bondage of Egypt by His
mighty power, and dwelt among them thenceforth as
among no other people. He gave them a land to dwell
in, and there as in His own house He watched and tended
them, and strove to lead them upwards to the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
their calling as the people of God by demanding of them
faith and love. It is a very enlightening remark of
Robertson Smith's that the deliverance out of Egypt was
to Israel in the Old Testament what conversion is to
the individual Christian according to the New Testament.
Taking that as our starting-point, we see that the thought
of Deuteronomy is precisely the thought of Romans. It
is said, and truly enough, that the Pauline theology was
a direct transcript of Paul's own experience; but we see
from this that he did not need to form the moulds for his
own fundamental thoughts. Long before him the author
of Deuteronomy had formed these, and they must have
been familiar to every instructed Jew. But the recognition
of this is not a loss but a gain. If St. Paul had
founded a theory of the universal action of God upon the
soul only on the grounds of his own very peculiar experience,
it might be argued that the basis of his teaching had
been too personal to permit us to feel sure that his view
was really as exhaustive as he thought. We see, however,
that what he experienced the Deuteronomist had
long before traced in the history of his people; and most
probably he would not have traced it with so firm a hand
had he not himself had experience of a similar kind in his
personal relations with God. This method of conceiving
the relation of God to the higher life of man, therefore, is
stated by the Scriptures as normal. The free grace of God
is the source and the sustainer of all spiritual life, whether
in individuals or communities. Ultimately, behind all the
successful or unsuccessful efforts of the human heart and
will, we are taught to see the great Giver, waiting to be
gracious, willing that all men should be saved, but acting
with the strangest reserves and limitations, choosing Israel
among the nations, and even within Israel choosing <em>the</em>
Israel in whom alone the promises can be realised. Made
to serve by human sin, He waits upon the caprices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
wills He has created. He does not force them; but with
compassionate patience He builds up His Holy Temple
of such living stones as offer themselves, and "without
haste as without rest" prepares for the consummation of
His work in the redemption of a people that shall be all
prophets, a kingdom of priests, a holy nation unto whom
all nations shall join themselves when they see that God
is in them of a truth. That is the Old Testament conception
of the source, and guarantee, and goal of all spiritual
life in the world, and St. Paul's view is merely a more
mature and definite form of the same thing. And wherever
spiritual life has manifested itself with unusual power, the
same consciousness of utter unworthiness on the part of
man, and entire dependence upon the grace and favour
of God, has also manifested itself. The intellectual difficulties
connected with this view, great as they are, have
never suppressed it; the pride of man and his faith in
himself have not been able permanently to obscure it.
The greater men are, the more entirely do they dread
any approach to that self-exaltation which puts away as
unnecessary the Divine hand stretched out to them. As
Dean Church points out,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> "not Hebrew prophets only,
but the heathen poets of Greece looked with peculiar and
profound alarm upon the haughty self-sufficiency of men."
Nothing can, they think, ward off evil from the man who
makes the mistake of supposing, even when carrying out
the Divine will, that he needs only his own strength of
brain and will and arm to succeed, that he is accountable
to no one for the character which he permits success to
build up within him.</p>

<p>Even the agnostic of to-day, as represented by Professor
Huxley, cannot do without some modicum of "grace" in
his conception of man's relation to the powers of nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
though to admit this is to run a rift of inconsistency
through his whole system of thought. "Suppose," he
says in his <cite>Lay Sermons</cite>, "it were perfectly certain that
the life and future of every one of us would, one day or
other, depend on his winning or losing a game at chess....
The chessboard is the world, the pieces are the
phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are
what we call the laws of nature. The player on the
other side is hidden from us. We know that his play
is always fair, just, patient. But we know to our cost
that he never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest
allowance for ignorance. To the man who plays well
the highest stakes are paid with that overflowing
generosity with which the strong shows delight in
strength, and one who plays ill is checkmated without
haste, but without remorse. My metaphor will remind
you of the famous picture in which the Evil One is depicted
playing a game of chess with man for his soul. Substitute
for the mocking fiend in that picture a calm, strong angel,
playing, as we say, for love, and who would rather lose
than win, and I should accept it as the image of human
life." Even in a world without God, therefore, the facts
of life suggest "justice," "patience," "generosity," and
a pity which "would rather lose than win." With all the
inexorable rigour and hardness of man's lot there is mingled
something that suggests "grace" in the power that rules
the world; and from the Deuteronomist to St. Paul, from
Augustine to Calvin and Professor Huxley, the resolutely
thorough thinkers have found, in the last analysis, these
two elements, the rigour of law and the election of grace,
working together in the moulding of mankind.</p>

<p>The statement of these facts in Deuteronomy is as
thorough as any that succeeded it. The rigour of law
could not be more precisely and pathetically declared than
in this insistence on the blessing or the curse which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
must inevitably follow right choice or wrong. But the
tenderness of grace could not be more attractively
displayed than in this picture of Yahweh's dealings with
Israel. Love never faileth here, no more than elsewhere.
It persists, notwithstanding stiff-necked rebellion, and in
spite of coarse materialism of nature. Even a childish
fickleness, more utterly trying than any other weakness
or defect, cannot wear it out. But inexorable blessing
or curse is blended with it, and helps to work out the
final result for Israel and mankind. That is the manner
of the government of God, according to the Scriptures.
History in its long course as known to us now confirms
the view; and the author of Deuteronomy, in thus blending
love and law together in the end of this great exhortation,
has rested the obligation to obedience on a foundation
which cannot be moved.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><i>LAW AND RELIGION</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xii.-xxvi.</h4>


<p>With this section (chapters xii.-xxvi.) we have at
length reached the legislation to which all that has
gone before is, in form at least, a prelude. But in its general
outline this code, if it can be so called, has a very unexpected
character. When we speak of a code of laws in
modern days, what we mean is a series of statutes, carefully
arranged under suitable heads, dealing with the rights
and duties of the people, and providing remedies for all
possible wrongs. Then behind these laws there is the
executive power of the Government, pledged to enforce
them, and ready to punish any breaches of them which
may be committed. In most cases, too, definite penalties
are appointed for any disregard or transgression of them.
Each word has been carefully selected, and it is understood
that the very letter of the laws is to be binding.
Every one tried by them knows that the exact terms of
the laws are to be pressed against him, and that the thing
aimed at is a rigorous, literal enforcement of every detail.
Tried by such a conception, this Deuteronomic legislation
looks very extraordinary and unintelligible.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is very little of orderly sequence
in it. Some large sections of it have a consecutive character;
but there is no perceptible order in the succession
of these sections, and there has been very little attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to group the individual precepts under related heads.
Moreover in many sections there is no mention of a
penalty for disobedience, nor is there any machinery for
enforcing the prescriptions of the code. There is, too,
much in it that seems rather to be good advice, or direction
for leading a righteous life, a life becoming an Israelite
and a servant of Yahweh, than law. For instance, such
a prescription as this, "If there be with thee a poor
man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates, in thy
land which Yahweh thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not
harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor
brother," can in no sense be treated as a law, in the hard
technical sense of that word. It stands exactly on a level
with the exhortations of the New Testament, <i>e.g.</i> "Be
not wise in your own conceits," "Render to no man evil
for evil," and rather sets up an ideal of conduct which is
to be striven after than establishes a law which must be
complied with. There is no punishment prescribed for
disobedience. All that follows if a man do harden his
heart against his poor brother is the sting of conscience,
which brings home to him that he is not living according
to the will of God. In almost every respect, therefore,
this Deuteronomic code differs from a modern code, and
in dealing with it we must largely dismiss the ideas which
naturally occur to us when we speak of a code of laws.
Our conception of that is, clearly, not valid for these
ancient codes; and we need not be surprised if we find
that they will not bear being pressed home in all their
details, as modern codes must be, and are meant to be.
Great practical difficulties have arisen in India, Sir Henry
Maine assures us, from applying the ideas of Western
lawyers to the ancient and sacred codes of the East. He
says that the effect of a procedure under which all the
disputes of a community must be referred to regular law-courts
is to stereotype ascertained usages, and to treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the oracular precepts of a sacred book as texts and precedents
that must be enforced. The consequence is that
vague and elastic social ordinances, which have hitherto
varied according to the needs of the people, become fixed
and immutable, and an Asiatic society finds itself arrested
and, so to speak, imprisoned unexpectedly within its own
formulas. Inconsistencies and contradictions, which were
never perceived when these laws were worked by Easterns,
who had a kind of instinctive perception of their true
nature, became glaring and troublesome under Western
rule, and much unintentional wrong has resulted. May
it not be that the same thing has happened in the domain
of literature in connection with these ancient Hebrew
laws? Discrepancies, small and great, have been the
commonplace of Pentateuch criticism for many years past,
and on them very far-reaching theories have been built.
It may easily be that some of these are the result rather
of our failure to take into account the elastic nature of
Asiatic law, and that a less strained application of modern
notions would have led to a more reasonable interpretation.</p>

<p>But granting that ordinary ancient law is not to be taken
in our rigorous modern sense, yet the fact that what we
are dealing with here is Divine law may seem to some to
imply that in all its details it was meant to be fulfilled
to the letter. If not, then in what sense is it inspired,
and how can we be justified in regarding it as Divinely
given? The reply to that is, of course, simply this, that
inspiration makes free use of all forms of expression which
are common and permissible at the time and place at
which it utters itself. From all we know of the Divine
methods of acting in the world, we have no right to
suppose that in giving inspired laws God would create
entirely new and different forms for Himself. On the
contrary, legislation in ancient Israel, though Divine in
its source, would naturally take the ordinary forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
ancient law. Moreover in this case it could hardly have
been otherwise. As has already been pointed out, a large
part of the Mosaic legislation must have been adopted
from the customs of the various tribes who were welded
into one by Moses. It cannot be conceived that the laws
against stealing, for example, the penalties for murder, or
the prescriptions for sacrifice, can have been first introduced
by the great Lawgiver. He made much ancient
customary law to be part and parcel of the Yahwistic
legislation by simply taking it over. If so, then all that
he added would naturally, as to form, be moulded on
what he found pre-existing. Consequently we may apply
to this law, whether Divinely revealed or adopted, the
same tests and methods of interpretation as we should
apply to any other body of ancient Eastern law.</p>

<p>Now of ancient Eastern codes the laws of Manu are the
nearest approach to the Mosaic codes, and their character
is thus stated by themselves (chap. i., ver. 107): "In this
work the sacred law has been fully stated, as well as the
good and bad qualities of human actions and the immemorial
rule of conduct to be followed by all." That means
that in the code are to be found ritual laws, general moral
precepts, and a large infusion of immemorial customs. And
its history, as elicited by criticism, has very interesting
hints to give us as to the probable course of legal development
in primitive nations. It is sometimes said that the
results of the criticism of the Old Testament, if true,
present us with a literature which has gone through
vicissitudes and editorial processes for which literary
history elsewhere affords absolutely no parallel. However
that may be as regards the historical and prophetical
books, it is not true with regard to the legal portions of
the Pentateuch. The very same processes are followed in
Professor Buhler's Introduction to his translation of the
<cite>Laws of Manu</cite>, forming Vol. XXV. of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span><i>The Sacred Books
of the East</i>, as are followed in the critical commentaries
on the Old Testament law codes. Pages lxvii. <i>seq.</i> of
Buhler's Introduction read exactly like an extract from
Kuenen or Dillmann; and the analysis of the text, with
its resultant list of interpolations, runs as much into detail
as any similar analysis in the Old Testament can do.
Moreover the conjectures as to the growth of Manu's code
are, in many places, parallel to the critical theories of the
growth of the Mosaic codes. The foundation of Manu is,
in the last resort, threefold&mdash;the teaching of the Vedas, the
decisions of those acquainted with the law, and the customs
of virtuous Aryas. At a later time the teachers of the
Vedic schools gathered up the more important of these
precepts, decisions, and customs into manuals for the use
of their pupils, written at first in aphoristic prose, and later
in verse. These, however, were not systematic codes at
all. As the name given them implies, they were strings
of maxims or aphorisms. Later, these were set forth as
binding upon all, and were revised into the form of which
the <cite>Laws of Manu</cite> is the finest specimen.</p>

<p>In Israel the process would appear to have been similar,
though much simpler. It was similar; for though there
are radical differences between the Aryan and the Semitic
mind which must not be overlooked, the former being
more systematic and fond of logical arrangement than the
latter, a great many of the things which are common to
Moses and Manu are quite independent of race, and are
due to the fact that both legislations were to regulate the
lives of men at the same stage of social advancement.
But Manu was much later than Moses. Indeed, as we
now have them, the laws of Manu are as late as the post-Ezraite
Judaic code, and in temper and tone these two
codes very nearly resemble each other. Consequently the
earlier codes of the Pentateuch are simpler than Manu.
When Israel left Egypt, custom must have been almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
alone the guide of life. Moses' task was to promulgate
and force home his fundamental truths; in this view he
must adopt and remodel the customary law so as to make it
innocuous to the higher principles he introduced, or even
to make it a vehicle for the popularising of them. So far
as he made codes, he would make them with that end.
Consequently he would take up mainly such prominent
points as were most capable of being, or which most
urgently needed to be, moralised, leaving all the rest to
custom where it was harmless. This is the reason, too,
most probably, why the earlier codes are so short and so
unsystematic. They are selections which needed special
attention, not complete codes covering the whole of life.
In fact the form and contents of all the Old Testament
codes can be accounted for only on this supposition. As
the codes lengthen, they do so simply by taking up, in a
modified or unmodified form, so much more of the custom;
and under the pressure of Yahwistic ideas these selected
codes became more and more weighted with spiritual
significance and power.</p>

<p>That would seem to have been the process by which
the inspired legislators of Israel did their work; and if it
be so, some of the variations which are now taken to be
certain indications of different ages and circumstances
may simply represent local varieties of the same custom.
Custom tends always to vary with the locality within
certain narrow limits. It would be quite in accord with
the general character of ancient customary law to believe
that, provided the law was on the whole observed, there
would be no inclination to insist upon excluding small
local variations; and equally so that in a collection like the
Pentateuch the custom of one locality should appear in
one place, that of another in another. In that case, to
insist that a certain sacrifice, for example, shall always
consist of the same number of animals, and that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
variation means a new and later legislation on the subject,
is only to make a mistake. The discrepancy is made
important only by applying modern English views of law
to ancient law. Professor A. B. Davidson has shown in
the Introduction to his <cite>Ezekiel</cite> (p. liii.) that this latter was
probably Ezekiel's view. "On any hypothesis of priority,"
he says, "the differences in details between him (<i>i.e.</i>
Ezekiel) and the law (<i>i.e.</i> P) may be easiest explained by
supposing that, while the sacrifices in general and the
ideas which they expressed were fixed and current, the
particulars, such as the kind of victims and the number
of them, the precise quantity of meal, oil, and the like, were
held non-essential and alterable when a change would
better express the idea." The same principle would apply
to the differences between Ezekiel and Deuteronomy, <i>e.g.</i>
the omission of the feast of weeks and of the law of the
offering of the firstlings of the flock. If so, then obviously
Ezekiel must have thought that the previous ritual law
was not meant to be as binding as we make it.</p>

<p>But, as has already been remarked, this law was elastic
in more important matters; often, even when it seems to
legislate, it is only setting up ideals of conduct. Before
we leave this subject an example should be given, and the
law of war may serve, especially if we compare it with the
corresponding section of Manu. The provisions in Deuteronomy
chap. xx. according to which on the eve of a battle
the officers should proclaim to the army that any man
who had built a new house and had not dedicated it, or
who had planted a vineyard and had not yet used the
fruit of it, or who had betrothed a wife and not yet taken
her, or who was afraid, should retire from the danger, as
also the provisions that forbid the destruction of fruit-trees
belonging to a besieged city, cannot have been meant
as absolute laws. Yet that is no ground for supposing
that they could have been introduced only after Israel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
having ceased to be a sovereign state, waged no war, and
that consequently they are interpolations in the original
Deuteronomy. For the similar provisions of the laws
of Manu were given while kings reigned, and were
addressed to men constantly engaged in war. Yet this
is what we find: "When he (the king) fights with his
foes in battle, let him not strike with weapons concealed
(in wood), nor with (such as are) barbed, poisoned, or the
points of which are blowing with fire. Let him not strike
one who (in flight) has climbed on an eminence, nor a
eunuch, nor one who joins the palms of his hands (in
supplication), nor one (who flees) with flying hair, nor one
who sits down, nor one who says 'I am thine,' nor one
who sleeps, nor one who has lost his coat of mail, nor
one who is naked, nor one who is disarmed, nor one who
looks on without taking part in the fight, nor one who is
fighting with another foe, nor one whose weapons are
broken, nor one afflicted (with sorrow), nor one who has
been grievously wounded, nor one who is in fear, nor one
who has turned to flight; but in all these cases let him
remember the duty (of honourable warriors)." With an
exact and unremitting obligation to observe these precepts
war would be impossible, and we may be sure that in
neither case were they meant in that sense. They simply
set forth the conduct which a chivalrous soldier would
desire to follow, and would on fitting occasions actually
follow; but by no means what he must do, or else break with
his religion. Only by hypotheses like these can the form
and the character of such laws be properly explained,
and if we keep them constantly in mind, some at least
of the difficulties which result from a comparison of the
law and the histories may be mitigated.</p>

<p>Such being the character of the Deuteronomic code, the
question has been raised whether its introduction and
acceptance by Josiah was not a falling away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
spirituality of ancient religion. Many modern writers,
supported by St. Paul's <i>dicta</i> concerning the law, say that
it was. Indeed the very mention of law seems to
depress writers on religion in these days, and Deuteronomy
appears to be to them a name of fear. But whatever
tendencies of modern thinking may have brought this
about, it is nevertheless true that experience embodied in
custom and law is the kindly nurse, not the deadly enemy,
of moral and spiritual life. Without law a nation would
be absolutely helpless; and it is inconceivable that at any
stage of Israel's history they were without this guide and
support. As we have seen, they never were. First they
had customary law; then along with that short special
codes, <i>e.g.</i> the Book of the Covenant and the Deuteronomic
code; and even when the whole Pentateuchal law
as we have it had been elaborated, a good deal must still
have been left to custom. Consequently there was
nothing so startling and revolutionary in the introduction
of Deuteronomy as many have combined to represent.
Indeed it is difficult to see how it altered anything in this
respect. Of all forms of law, customary law is perhaps
that which demands and receives most unswerving obedience.
Under it, therefore, the pressure of law was
heavier than it could be in any other form. It does not
appear how the fact that those observing it did not think
of that which they obeyed as law, but simply custom,
altered the essential nature of their relation to it. They
were guided by ordinances which did not express their
own inward conviction, and were not a product of their
own thought. They obeyed ordinances from without, and
these ought therefore to have had the same effect upon
the moral and spiritual life as written laws. For they
cannot be said to have regulated only civil life. Religious
life (even if the Book of the Covenant be Mosaic or sub-Mosaic,
as I believe; much more if it be post-Davidic, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
many say) must have been largely regulated by the
customs of Israel. If law then be in its own nature, as
the antinomians tell us, destructive of spontaneity and
progress, if it necessarily externalises religion, then there
would have been as little room for the religion of the
prophets before Deuteronomy as after it.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, no falling off in spirituality took
place after Deuteronomy. Wellhausen says that with
law freedom came to an end, and this was the death of
prophecy. But he can support his thesis only by denying
the name of prophet to all the prophets after Jeremiah.
It is difficult to see the basis of such a distinction. It is
judged by this, if by nothing else&mdash;that it compels Wellhausen
to deny that the author of Second Isaiah is a
prophet. That he wrote anonymously is held to prove
that he felt this himself. Now a view so extraordinarily
superficial has no root, and every reader of that most
touching and sublime of all the Old Testament books
will simply stand amazed at the depth of the critical
prejudice which could dictate such a judgment. If the
post-Deuteronomic prophets are not prophets, then there
are no prophets at all, and the whole discussion becomes
a useless logomachy. But even if Ezekiel and Second
Isaiah and the rest are not prophets, they are at least full
of spiritual life and power, so that the decay of spiritual
religion which the adoption of Deuteronomy is supposed
to have brought about must be considered purely imaginary
on that ground also. And this contention is strengthened
by the theories of the critical school themselves. If the
bulk of the Psalms, as all critics incline to believe, or
all of them, as some say, are post-exilic, then the first
centuries of the post-exilic period must have been the most
spiritually minded epoch in Israelite history. The depth
of religious feeling exhibited in the Psalms, and the comprehension
of the inwardness of man's true relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
God by which they are penetrated, are the exact contrary
of the externality and superficiality which the introduction
of written law is said to have produced. So long as the
Psalms were being written religious life must have been
vigorous and healthy, and to date the beginnings of
Pharisaic externalism from Josiah's day must consequently
be an error.</p>

<p>After what has been said it is scarcely necessary to
discuss Duhm's views of the opposition between prophecy
and Deuteronomy. It will be sufficient to ask how the
latter can have turned against prophecy, when it is in its
essence an embodiment of prophetic principles in law, and
was introduced and supported by prophets. But, it may
be said, after all prophecy did decay, and ultimately die,
and that too during the period after Deuteronomy. Is
there not in that admitted fact a presumption that this law
did work against prophecy? If so, then it is more than
met by the fact that the decay of spiritual religion became
noticeable only some centuries after this, and that the
immediate effect of Deuteronomy was rather to deepen
and intensify religion, and to keep it alive amid all the
vicissitudes of the Captivity and Return. Moreover the
break-up of the national life was sufficient to account for
the slow decay and final cessation of prophecy. From the
first, prophecy had been concerned with the building up
of a nation which should be faithful to Yahweh. Its main
function had been to interpret and to foretell the great
movements and crises of national life&mdash;to read God's
purpose in the great world-movements and to proclaim it.
With Israel's death as a nation the field of prophecy
became gradually circumscribed, and ultimately its voice
ceased. Consequently, though in the main the final
cessation of prophecy was connected with the rise of
externalism in religion and with the great decay of spiritual
life in the two or three centuries before Christ, the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of the nation would account for the feebleness of
prophecy during a period when the inner spiritual life was
flourishing as it flourished after Deuteronomy. Moreover,
as religion became more inward and personal, prophecy,
in the Old Testament sense, had less place. Though in
New Testament times spiritual life and spiritual originality
and power were more present than at any time in the
world's history, prophecy did not revive. In the whole
New Testament there is not one purely prophetic book
save the Revelation, and that is apocalyptic more than
simply prophetic; and though there was an order of
prophets in the early Church, if they had any special
function other than that of preachers their office soon died
out. If then the denationalising of religion and its
growth in individualism and inwardness in New Testament
times prevented the revival of prophecy, we may
surely gather that the same things, and not the introduction
of written law, brought it to an end in the Old
Testament.</p>

<p>Nor does St. Paul's judgment as to the meaning and use
of law, in Galatians, when rightly understood, contradict
this. No doubt he seems to say that the Mosaic law by
its very nature as law is incompatible with grace, that it
necessarily stands out of relation to faith, and that its
principle is a purely external one, so much wages for so
much work. Further, he clearly regards it as having been
interpolated into the history of Israel between the promises
given to Abraham and the fulfilment of them in the
redemption by Christ, and as having served only to
increase sin and to drive men thus to Christ. But when
he says this he is replying mainly to the Pharisaic view
of the law which was represented by the Judaizers, and
finds himself all the more at home in refuting it that it
was his own view before he became a Christian. According
to that view, the whole law, both the moral and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
ceremonial provisions of it, was necessary to obtain moral
righteousness, and the mere doing of the legally prescribed
things gave a claim to the promised reward. So
interpreted, law had all the evil qualities he states, and
stood in absolute hostility to grace and faith, the great
Christian principles. The only difficulty is that St. Paul
does not say, as we should expect him to do, that originally
the law was not meant to be so regarded. He seems to
admit by his silence that the Pharisaic view of the law
was the right one. But if he does, he cannot have meant
to include Deuteronomy. For there law is made to have
its root and ground in grace. It is given to Israel as a
token of the free love of God, and it is a law of life which,
if kept, would make them a peculiar people unto God.
Further, love to God is to be the motive from which all
obedience springs, so that this law is bound up with both
grace and faith. But the probability is that St. Paul
admits the Pharisaic view only because it is that view with
which alone he has to contend in the case in hand. For
in Romans vii. he gives us quite another conception of
the Mosaic law.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> There he is thinking of it mainly from
an ethical point of view, and he regards it as full of the
Spirit of God, as a norm of moral life which not only
continues to be valid in Christianity, but which finds in
the Christian life the very fulfilment which it was intended
to have. It presses home too the moral ideal upon the
man with extraordinary power, and marks and emphasises
the terrible divergence between his aspirations and his
actual performance. This is a much higher office than
that which he assigns to law in Galatians; and hence one
gathers that he is not speaking in Galatians exhaustively
and conclusively, but is condemning rather a way of regarding
the Mosaic law with which he had once sympathised
than that law in its own essential character. In its moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
aspects, as represented by the Decalogue, the law is of
eternal obligation. From it comes the light which brings
to the Christian that moral unrest and dissatisfaction which
is one of God's Divinest gifts to His people. In this aspect,
the law is holy and just and good: instead of favouring
the critical view St. Paul leaves it without any fragment
of real support.</p>

<p>Our conclusion is, therefore, that the antinomianism,
which makes the acknowledgment of Deuteronomy by
Josiah and his people the turning-point for the worse
in the religious history of Israel, is unfounded. The
nation had always been under law, and previous to
Deuteronomy under even written law. This code was
not in any previously unheard-of way made the law of
the kingdom. Its very contents are conclusive against
that view, for it contains much that could not be enforced
by the State. Instead of trying to do by external means
that which the persuasions of the prophets had failed to
do, Josiah and his people did just what they would have
had to do, when they became convinced that the prophetic
principles ought to be carried out. They made an agreement
to follow these Divine commands, these God-given
principles, in actual life. But there is no hint that they
regarded Deuteronomy as the sum of the Divine ordinances
for the life of men. Indeed there are many references to
other Divine laws; and the priestly oracle remained, after
Deuteronomy as before it, a source of Divine guidance.
Deuteronomy therefore did not destroy prophecy; the post-exilic
Psalms are proof that it did not destroy spiritual life:
and the Pauline view of the law, in at least one series of
passages, coincides entirely with the view that law stated
as it is stated in Deuteronomy may be one of the mightiest
influences to mould, and enrich, and deepen, moral and
spiritual life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><i>LAWS OF SACRIFICE</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xii.</h4>


<p>It is a characteristic of all the earlier codes of law&mdash;the
Book of the Covenant, the Deuteronomic Code, and
the Law of Holiness&mdash;that at the head of the series of
laws which they contain there should be a law of sacrifice.
Probably, too, each of the three had, as first section of all, the
Decalogue. The Book of the Covenant and Deuteronomy
undeniably have it so, and the earlier element which forms
the basis of Lev. xvii.-xxvi. not improbably had originally
the same form. If so, we may assume that the order of
the precepts has in a measure been determined by the
order of the commandments. On this account the laws
for the cultus would naturally come first. For just as
the first commandment is, "Thou shalt have no other god
before Me," and the second forbids all idolatrous images,
so the laws begin with provisions meant in the main to
ward off idolatry. Israel's great calling was to receive
and to spread the truth concerning God. That was the
centre of the sacred deposit of Divine and revealed truth
committed to that nation; and it is most instructive to see
how, not only in historical statements, but even in the
form in which early Israelite legislation is handed down
to us, the Decalogue dominates all the details of it. It
formulated in as concrete a shape as was possible the
Divine demand that Israelites should love God and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
neighbour, and <em>therefore</em> the legislative provisions and
statutes begin with ordinances dealing with sacrifice.</p>

<p>To us in modern times it may seem almost bathos to
connect such an antecedent with such a consequent; but
it seems so, only because we have difficulty in apprehending
the meaning and importance of sacrifice in primitive religion.
For sacrifice had in Israel a meaning and importance
of its own, and a present value at every period, which in
no way depended upon its typical or prophetic value as
pointing forward to the sacrifice of Christ. It supplied
the religious needs of men even apart from the clearness
of their knowledge about its ultimate purpose. Sacrifice,
especially in its simplest meaning, was in heathenism
absolutely essential as a means of approach to God. To
come before a great <em>man</em> without a gift was in ancient
days an outrage. It was therefore inevitable that men
should approach their gods in the same manner. Sacrificial
gifts expressed the dependent's joy in a gracious lord, and
also the homage and reverence due from a subject to a
king. Further, as all good things were regarded as the
gifts of the gods to their worshippers, the sacrifices conveyed
thanks for good gifts received, and joined the gods
and their worshippers by a common participation in the
Divine gift which connected them as eaters at the same
table. But sacrifices had a higher reach of expression
even than that. As they were brought to the gods they
were the symbols of the self-devotion of the offerer to
the service of his god; and where there was need of propitiation
because of offence consciously given, or offence
felt by the deity for unknown reasons, these gifts took on
in some measure a reconciling or propitiatory quality.</p>

<p>Now the Old Testament sacrifices had in them, unquestionably,
all these elements: but as Yahweh was high
above all heathen deities in moral character, they also
took on a depth and intensity of meaning which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
could never have on the soil of heathen religious conceptions.
Along this line of sacrificial ritual, therefore, all
the spiritual emotions of Israel flowed; and to hold that
sacrifice had no real place in the religion of Yahweh
would be almost equivalent to saying that neither love,
nor penitence, nor prayer, had any real place in it either.
All these found utterance in sacrifice and along with it;
and it has yet to be shown that they had any regular and
acceptable utterance otherwise. To regulate sacrifice and
keep it pure must, therefore, have been one chief means
of guarding against the degradation of Yahweh to the
level of the gods of the heathen.</p>

<p>But there is another and very important reason for it.
Both in the days when Moses parted from his people, and
also in the time of Manasseh, the people stood confronted
by very special danger just at this point.</p>

<p>At the earlier period they were about to enter upon
intimate contact with the Canaanites, their superiors
in culture and in all the arts of civilised life, but corrupted
to the core. Further, the Canaanite corruption
was focussed in their religious rites and worship, and
evil could not fail to follow if the people suffered themselves
to be drawn into any participation in it. For if
Professor Robertson Smith be right, the central point of
ancient sacrifice was the communion between the god and
his worshippers in the sacrificial feast. They became of
one kin with each other and with the god, and this close
relationship made the communication of spiritual and moral
infection almost a certainty.</p>

<p>In Manasseh's day again it was natural that legislation
on the same subject, and warnings of even a more solemn
kind, should be repeated. A prophetic lawgiver writing
at that date had before him, not only the possibility of
evil, but actual experience of it. The laws and warnings
of the earlier code had been defied and neglected. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
faith of the chosen people had been miserably perverted
by contact with the Canaanites; the whole history of
prophecy had been a struggle against corrupt and insincere
worship; and now the monstrous sacrifices to Moloch and
the invasion of Assyrian idolatry had degraded Yahweh
and destroyed His people, so that scarce any hope of
recovery remained. In bracing himself for one more
struggle with this desperate corruption, the Deuteronomist
naturally repeated in deeper tones the Mosaic warnings.
The command utterly to uproot and trample under foot
the symbols and instruments of Canaanite worship, he
brings, from the less prominent place it occupies in the
Book of the Covenant, to the first place in his own code.
To break with that and all other forms of idolatry, utterly
and decisively, had come to be the first condition of any
upward movement. The degrading and defiling bondage
to idolatry into which his people had fallen must end.
With trumpet tongue he calls upon them to break down
the Canaanite altars, dash in pieces their obelisks, and
burn their Asherim with fire.</p>

<p>To some moderns it may seem that such excessive
energy might, with better effect, have been expended upon
the denunciation of moral evils, such as cruelty and lust
and oppression, rather than of idolatry. We have grown
so accustomed to the distinctions drawn by the Church
of Rome, and in later times by the neo-classicists, between
worshipping God through an image or a picture, or
in any natural object or natural force, and the actual
worship of the image or picture or natural object itself,
that we have sophisticated our minds. But the author
of Deuteronomy knew by bitter experience that such
subtle, and, in great part, sophistical distinctions had no
application to his people and his time. Their worst
immoralities were, he knew well, rooted in their idol-worship.
For idolatry in any form binds all that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
highest in man to the sphere of nature, <i>i.e.</i> of moral indifference.
Just as a conception of God which rigorously
separated Him from nature, which made His will the
supreme impelling force in the world, and which conceived
His essential attributes to be entirely ethical, was the
fountain of the higher life in Israel, so a lapse into idolatry
of any kind was the negation of it all. No doubt some
moral life would have remained in Israel, even if the lapse
had become universal. But, even at its best, this natural
morality of self-preservation has no future and no goal.
It does not lead the van of human progress; it merely
comes after, to ratify the results of it. Only when social
morality is taken up into a wider sphere than its own,&mdash;only
when it is conceived as the path by which man can
co-operate with a sublime purpose lying beyond himself,&mdash;can
it maintain itself as the inspiration of human life,
impelling to progress and guiding it.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Now, so far as
history teaches, this energy of moral life has been attained
only where the conception of God which makes moral
perfection to be His essential nature has been accepted
and cherished. But no natural religion can rise to that;
hence idolatry must always be destructive of ethical religion.
It must destroy faith in the moral character of God.</p>

<p>Further, it must destroy the moral character of man.
In the last resort all idolaters are equally acceptable to
their god, if only they bring the prescribed gifts and
accurately perform the prescribed ceremonies. The lewd
and the chaste, the cruel and the merciful, the revengeful
and the forgiving, are all equally accepted when they
sacrifice. Non-moral or positively immoral gods can
care nothing about such differences. Of this fact and
its results no man acquainted with the history of Israel
could doubt. The main zeal of the prophets was at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
times directed against those who were steeped in moral
evil, but were zealous in all that concerned sacrifice, and
against the amazing folly of a people who thought to
bind the living God to their cause and their interests by
mere bribes, in the shape of thousands of bullocks and
ten thousand rivers of oil. This conception was bound
up essentially with idolatry. But the evil of it was
intensified in the Semitic idolatries with which Israel
specially defiled itself. Their cruelty and obscenity were
unspeakable. Now by Israel's idolatry Yahweh was made
to appear tolerant of Moloch and Baal, as if they were
equals. Every quality which the Mosaic revelation had
set forth as essential to the character of Yahweh&mdash;His
purity, His mercy, His truth&mdash;was outraged by the society
which His worshippers in Manasseh's days had thrust
upon Him. No reform, then, had the least chance of
stability till the axe was laid at the root of this wide-spreading
upas tree.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy, therefore, grapples first and grapples
thoroughly with the evil, and strikes it a blow from which
it was never to recover. The inspired writer repeats with
new energy the old decrees of utter destruction against
the Canaanite sanctuaries; for though these were for the
most part no longer in Canaanite hands, the High Places
still existed; and the principle of that old prohibition was
more clamant for recognition and realisation than it had
ever been in the history of Israel before.</p>

<p>Then he goes on to proclaim the new law, that no sacrifice
should any longer be offered save at the one central
sanctuary chosen by Yahweh. There is no such provision
in the Book of the Covenant, and there is no hint in
the legislation of Deuteronomy that its author knew of
the Tabernacle and its sole right as a place of sacrifice.
From beginning to end of the code he never mentions
the Tabernacle nor the sacrifices there; and in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
terms in which he permits the slaughter of animals for
food in vv. 15, 16, and 20-25, though he obviously repeals
a custom which has been embodied in the Priestly Code
as a law (Lev. xvii. 3 ff.), he makes no reference to that
passage. Consequently this at least may be said, that
he may quite conceivably have been ignorant of Lev.
xvii. 3 ff. In ignorance of it, he might write as he has
done; and if not ignorant, it would be much more natural
to refer to it. When we add to this negative testimony
the positive testimony of verses 8 and 13, which we have
already discussed in Chapter I., there would seem to
be little room for doubt that the priestly law on this
subject was not before the writer of Deuteronomy. Consequently
we are justified in regarding this as the first
written law actually promulgated on this subject.
Hezekiah had attempted the same reform; but he had,
so far as we know, neither published nor referred to
any law commanding it, and his work was entirely
undone. The Deuteronomist, more convinced than he
that this step was absolutely necessary to complete the
Mosaic legislation on idolatry, and filled with the same
inspiration of the Almighty, completed it; and though a
reaction followed Josiah's enforcement of this law also,
its existence saved the life of the nation. Its principles
kept the nation holy, <i>i.e.</i> separate to their God, during
the Exile, and at the return they were dominant in the
formation of the "congregation."</p>

<p>Certainly there is no lack of earnestness in the way
in which these principles are urged. With that love of
repetition which is a distinguishing mark of this writer,
he expresses the commandment first positively, then
negatively. Then he brings in the consequential alteration
in the law regarding the slaughtering of animals for
food. Again he returns to the command, explaining,
enlarging, insisting, and concludes with a reiteration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the permission to slaughter. Efforts, of course, have been
made to show that this repetition is due to the amalgamation
here of no fewer than seven separate documents!
But little heed need be given to such fantastic attempts.
It is, once for all, a habit of this writer's mind to shrink
from no monotony of this kind. There is not one important
idea in his book which he does not repeat again
and again; and where repetition is so constant a feature,
and where the language and thought is so consistent as
it is here, it is worse than useless to assert separate
documents. The writer's earnestness is sufficient explanation.
He saw plainly that, so long as the provincial
High Places existed and were popular, it would
be impossible to secure purity of worship. The heathen
conceptions of the Canaanites clung about their ancient
sanctuaries, and, like the mists from a fever swamp,
infected everything that came near. Inspection sufficiently
minute and constant to be of use was impracticable;
there remained nothing but to decree their abandonment.
When the whole worship of the people was
centred at Jerusalem, corruption of the idolatrous kind
would, it was hoped, be impossible. There, a pious king
could watch over it; there, the Temple priesthood had
attained to worthier ideas in regard to sacrifice and the
fulfilment of the law than the priests elsewhere. Josiah
accordingly rigorously enforced this new law.</p>

<p>Such a change, aimed solely at religious ends, did not
stop there. In many ways it affected the social life of the
people; in vv. 15, 16, and 20, 24, the author meets one
hardship connected with the new law, by allowing men to
slay for food at a distance from the altar. According to
ancient custom, no flesh could be eaten by any Israelite,
save when the fat and the blood had been presented
at the altar. During the wilderness journey there would
be little difficulty regarding this. In the desert very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
little meat is eaten; and so long as life was nomadic
there would be no hardship in demanding that those
who wished to make sacrificial feasts should wander
towards the central place of worship rather than from it.
It has been disputed whether there was in those days a
tabernacle such as the Priestly Code describes; but there
certainly was, according to the earliest documents, a tent
in which Yahweh revealed Himself and gave responses.
As we have seen, there must have been sacrifice in
connection with it; and though worship at other places
where Yahweh had made His name to be remembered
was permitted, this sanctuary in the camp must have had
a certain pre-eminence. A tendency, but according to
the words of Deuteronomy nothing stronger than a
tendency, must have shown itself to make this the main
place of worship.</p>

<p>When the people crossed the Jordan into the land promised
to the fathers, and had abandoned the nomadic
life, great difficulty must have arisen. For those at a
distance from the place where the Tabernacle was set up,
the eating of meat and the enjoyment of sacrificial feasts
would, by this ancient customary law, have been rendered
impossible, if the attendance at one sanctuary had been
obligatory. Only if men could come to local sanctuaries,
each in his own neighbourhood, could the religious character
of the festivals at which meat was eaten be preserved.
The nature of men's occupations, now that they
had become settled agriculturists, and the dangers from
the Canaanites so long as they were not entirely subdued
and absorbed, alike forbade such long and frequent
journeys to a central sanctuary. The conquest must
consequently at once have checked any tendency to
centralisation that may have existed; and there is reason
to believe that the acceptance of the Canaanite High Places
as sanctuaries of Yahweh was in great part caused by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
demands of this ancient law concerning the "zebhach."
In any case it must have helped to overcome any scruples
that may have existed. But when the Tabernacle and
Ark were brought to Zion, and still more when the
Temple was built, the centripetal tendency, never altogether
dead, must have revived. For there was peace throughout
the land and beyond it. No danger from the Canaanites
existed; and the political centralisation which Solomon
aimed at, and actually carried out, as well as the superior
magnificence of the Solomonic Temple and its priests,
must have attracted to Jerusalem the thoughts and the
reverence of the whole people. What Deuteronomy now
makes law may have then first arisen as a demand of
the Jerusalem priests. At all events, the very existence
of the Temple must have been a menace to the High
Places; and we may be sure that among the motives
which led the ten tribes to reject the Davidic house,
jealousy for the local sanctuaries must have been
prominent.</p>

<p>But the separation of the ten tribes would only strengthen
the claim of the Temple on Zion to be for Judah the one
true place of worship. The territory ruled from Jerusalem
was now so small that resort to the central sanctuary
was comparatively easy. The glorious memories of the
Davidic and Solomonic time would centre round Jerusalem.
Any local sanctuaries would be entirely dwarfed
and overshadowed by the splendour and the, at least
comparative, purity of the worship there. Priests of local
altars too must inevitably have sunk in the popular estimation,
and even in their own, to a secondary and subordinate
position, as compared with the carefully organised and
strictly graded Jerusalem priests. Even without a positive
command, therefore, the people of Judah must have been
gradually growing into the habit of seeking Yahweh at
Jerusalem on all more solemn religious occasions; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
though the High Places might exist, their repute in the
Southern Kingdom must have been decreasing. Of course
if a command was given in the Mosaic time which had
been neglected, the tendencies here traced must have
been stronger and more definite than we have depicted
them. When the prophetic teachings of Isaiah which proclaimed
Jerusalem to be "Ariel," the "sacrificial hearth,"
or "the hearth of God," were so wondrously confirmed by
the destruction of Sennacherib's host before the city, the
unique position of Zion must have been secured; and after
that only those who were set upon idolatry can have
had much interest in the High Places. Hezekiah's effort
to abolish these latter is quite intelligible in these circumstances;
and we may feel assured that, as Wellhausen
says,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> "The Jewish royal temple had early overshadowed
the other sanctuaries, and in the course of the seventh
century they were extinct or verging on extinction."</p>

<p>Along with this there must have grown up a measure
of laxity in regard to the provision that all slaughtering
for food should take place at the sanctuary. Many would
doubtless go to Zion, many would continue to resort to the
High Places, and a number, from a mere halting between
two opinions, would probably take their "zebhachim"
to neither. Consequently the law before us would by
no means be so revolutionary as Duhm, for instance,
pictures it. He says: "I do not know if in the whole
history of the world a law can be pointed to which was
so fitted to change a whole people in its innermost nature
and in its outward appearance, at one stroke, as this was.
The Catholic Church even has never by all her laws succeeded
in anything in the least like it." But we have
seen evidence of a very strong and continuous pressure to
this point, at least in Judah. History during centuries had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
justified and intensified it; so that in all probability the
true worshippers of Yahweh found in the new law not so
much a revolution as a ratification of their already ancient
practice. To idolaters, of course, its adoption must have
meant a cessation of their idolatry; but the change in the
people and in their life would, though extensive, be only
such as any ordinary reform would produce. Duhm
overlooks altogether the very small territory which the
law affected. A long day's walk would bring men from
Jericho, from Hebron, from the borders of the Philistine
country, and from Shechem and Samaria to Jerusalem.
If Deuteronomy made a revolution, it must have been
confined within the modest limits of substituting a whole
for a half-day's journey to the Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Moreover it is a mistake to say that sacrifice at one
central sanctuary "took religion away from the people," as
Duhm says. If spiritual religion be meant, it ultimately
brought religion more vitally home to them. For when
the priestly system was fully carried out, the demands of
household religion were met, as the post-exilic Psalms
show, by the adoption of the practice of household prayer
without reference to sacrifice, and finally by the institution
of the synagogue. A more spiritual method of approach
to God was substituted for a less spiritual in the remote
places and in the homes of the people. And the public
worship even gained. It became deeper, and more penetrated
with a sense of the necessity of deliverance from
sin. It is true, of course, that in the end Pharisaic
legalism perverted the new forms of worship, as heathen
externalism had perverted the old. But in neither case
was the perversion a necessity. In both it was simply
a manifestation of the materialistic tendency which dogs
the footsteps of even the most spiritual religion, when it
has to realise itself in the life of man. It is enough for
the justification of the whole movement led by Josiah to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
say that it held the Jud√¶an exiles together; that it kept
alive in their hearts, as nothing else did, their faith in God
and in their future; and that on their return it gave them
the form which their institutions could most profitably
take. Further, under the forms of religious and social
life which this movement generated, the true, heartfelt piety
which the prophets so mourned the want of became more
common than ever it had been before.</p>

<p>The establishment of the central altar as the only one
was the main object of this law; but there is much to be
learned from the very terms in which this is expressed.
They breathe the same love for man and sympathy with
the poor which forms one of the most attractive characteristics
of our book. The gracious bonds of family
affection, the kindly feeling that should unite masters
and servants, the helpfulness which ought to distinguish
the conduct of the rich to the poor, and above all the
cheerful enjoyment of the results of honest labour,
are to be preserved and sanctified even in the ritual of
sacrifice. "Thou shalt rejoice before Yahweh in all that
thou puttest thine hand unto," is here the motto, if we
may so speak, of religious service. That, indeed, is to be
made the opportunity for the discharge of all humane and
brotherly duties; and the religious life is at its highest
when the worshipper rejoices himself, and shares and sheds
abroad his joy upon others. The love of God is here most
intimately blended with love of the brethren. Masters
and servants, slaves and free, the high and the low, are to
be reminded of their equal standing in the sight of God,
by their common participation in the sacrificial meals; and
the poorest are to be permitted an equal enjoyment of
the luxuries of the rich in these solemn approaches to
Yahweh. The Deuteronomist here reaches the highest
stage of religious life, in that he shows himself in nowise
afraid of human joy. As we have seen, he knows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
value of austerity in religion. He is well enough aware
that war against evil is not made with rose-water. But
then he is equally far from the extreme of suspecting
all affection not directly turned to God, of regarding
natural gladness as a ruinous snare to the soul. This
finely balanced, this just attitude to all aspects of life, is
a most notable thing at this epoch in the history of the
world, and considering the circumstances of the time it is
little short of a marvel. It is true, of course, that the
religion of Israel was always finely human. It could run
into excesses, and was marked by many imperfections;
but asceticism, the doctrine which holds pain and self-denial
to be in themselves good, when it did intrude into
Israel, always came from without. Nevertheless the
heartiness and thoroughness with which all gracious
human feelings and all kindly human relations are here
taken up into religion is remarkable, even in the Old
Testament. More, perhaps, than anything else in this
book, it shows the sweetening and wholesome effect of
demanding supreme love to God as man's first duty.
"If any man come to Me and hate not his father and
mother," says Christ, "he cannot be My disciple,"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and
many purblind critics have found this to be a hard saying.
But all who know men know, that when God in Christ is
made so much the supreme object of love that even the
most sacred human obligations seem to be disregarded in
comparison, the human affection so thrust into the background
is only made richer far than it otherwise could be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3><i>THE RELATION OF OLD TESTAMENT SACRIFICE TO
CHRISTIANITY</i></h3>


<p>But it may be asked, What is the relation of this
Divinely sanctioned ritual law of sacrifice to our
religion in its present phase? To that question various
answers are being returned, and indeed it may be said that
on this point almost all the main differences of Christians
turn. The Church of Rome maintains in essence the
sacerdotal view of the later Old Testament times, though
in a spiritualised Christian shape, and to this the High
Anglican view is a more or less pronounced return. The
Protestant Churches, on the other hand, regard priests and
sacrifices as anachronisms since the death of Christ. In
that, for the most part, they regard the significance of
sacrifice as being summed up and completed; and the
present dispensation is for them the realisation in embryo
of that which Old Testament saints looked forward to&mdash;a
people of God, every true member of which is both
priest and prophet, <i>i.e.</i> has free and unrestricted access to
God, and is authorised and required to speak in His name.
The interest of Protestant Christians, therefore, in priesthood
and sacrifice in the Old Testament sense, though very
great and enduring, has no connection with the continuation
of sacrifice. They look upon the Old Testament ritual as
wholly obsolete now. It was simply a stage in the religious
development of the chosen people, and as such it has no
claim to be continued among Christians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>By a curious allegorical process, however, some devout
Protestants keep alive their interest in Old Testament
ritual by finding in it an elaborate symbolism covering the
whole field of evangelical theology. But this revivification
of the old law is too arbitrary and subjective, as well as
too improbable, to have an abiding place in Christianity.
It is, moreover, useless for the guidance of life; for all that
is thus ingeniously put into the Levitical ordinances is
found more clearly and directly expressed elsewhere.
The amount of religious symbolism in the earlier stages
of Israelite religion is small, and very simple and direct.
Even in the most elaborate parts of the Levitical legislation,
<i>e.g.</i> in the directions regarding the Tabernacle, the purposely
allegorical element is kept within comparatively
narrow limits; and we may boldly say that the mind which
delights in finding spiritual mysteries in every detail of
the sacrificial ritual is Rabbinical rather than Christian.
On the other hand we need not enter upon a discussion of
the view held by "Modern" or Broad Church theologians
and by Unitarians, that sacrifice was merely a heathen
form taken over into Mosaism, that it had no special
significance there, and that the ideas connected with it
have absolutely no place in enlightened Christian theology.
The Christianity which attaches no sacrificial signification
to the death of Christ has, so far as I know, never shown
itself to be a type of religion able to create a future, and
it is only with types of Christianity that do and can live
we have to do. Our question here therefore is limited
to this, Which of the two types of view, the Roman
Catholic or the Protestant, is truest to the Old Testament
teaching?</p>

<p>Externally, perhaps, the evidence seems to favour the
Roman Catholic position; for the prophets either directly
say, or imply, that sacrifice shall be restored with new
purity and power in the Messianic time. This is so patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
a fact that it led Edward Irving to say that it was the Old
Testament economy that should abide, and that of the
New Testament which should pass away. But the inner
progress and development of Old Testament religion is
quite as decisively on the other side. As we have seen,
Old Testament piety had at the beginning almost no
recognised expression save in connection with sacrifice,
and the Exile first trained the people to faithfulness
to God without it, sowing the seed of a religious life
largely separate from the sacrificial ritual. Then the
ordinance demanding sacrifice at one central altar, which,
though introduced by Deuteronomy, was made the exclusive
law only by the post-exilic community, furthered
the growth of these germs, so that they produced the
synagogue system. This completed the severance of the
ordinary daily religion of the bulk of the people from
sacrificial ritual, so far as that was attained within the
limits of Judaism, and prepared the way for Pauline
Christianity, in which all allegiance to ritual Judaism is
cast off. Now, as between the external and internal
evidence, there can be little doubt that the latter has by
far the greater weight, especially as the external evidence
can, perfectly well, be read in a different sense. The Old
Testament promises that sacrifice should be restored may
be held to have been fulfilled by the sacrificial death of
Christ, which completed and filled up all that had gone
before. In that case the evidence that sacrifice and ritual
are now obsolete for Christians is left standing alone,
and the Protestant view is justified.</p>

<p>And the case for this view is strengthened immeasurably
by observing that the modern sacerdotalism has taken
up as essential what was the main vice of sacrificial
worship in the old economy. That was, as we have seen,
the tendency to rest on the mere performance of the
external rite, without reference to the disposition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
heart or even to conduct. Rivers of oil and hecatombs
of victims were thought sufficient to meet all possible
demands on God's part, and against this the polemic of
the prophets is unceasing. Now in almost all modern
sacerdotalism the doctrine of the efficacy of sacraments
duly administered, apart from right dispositions in either
him who administers them or in him who receives them,
has been affirmed. It is not now, as it was in the "old
time," an evil tendency which had to be assiduously
fought against, but which could not be overcome. It is
openly incorporated in the orthodox teaching, and is
distinctly provided for in the ideal of Christian worship.
That marks a considerable falling away from the prophetic
ideal: it can hardly be regarded as the appointed
end of that great religious movement which the prophets
dominated and directed for so long. The teaching of
Deuteronomy certainly is, that wherever mere external
acts are supposed to have power to secure entrance into
the spiritual world of life and peace, there the character
of God is misconceived and religion degraded. What it
demands is the inward and spiritual allegiance of faithful
men to God. What it depicts as the essence of religious
life is a set of the whole nature Godward, as deep and
irresistible as the set of the tides&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such a tide as moving seems asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Too full for sound and foam."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Under no sacerdotal system can that view be unreservedly
accepted, and therein lies the condemnation of every such
system. So far as it is allowed to prevail, the force of
the prophetic polemic has to be ignored or evaded, and in
greater or less degree the same spiritual decay which the
prophets mourned over in Israel must appear.</p>

<p>But it is not only where trust in the mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opus operatum</i>
is theoretically justified that it makes its baleful presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
felt. It may surreptitiously creep in where the door is
theoretically shut against it. The tendency is very deep-seated
in human nature; and many evangelical preachers,
who repudiate all sacramentarianism, and throw the full
emphasis of Christian religious life upon grace and faith,
yet bring back again in subtler shape that very thing
which they have rejected. For example, instead of the
reception of the sacrament at the hands of ordained
ministers, a man's acceptance with God is sometimes made
to depend upon a declaration of belief that Christ has died
for him, or that he has been redeemed and saved by Christ.
Wherever such statements are forced upon men, there
is a tendency to assume that a decisive step in the
spiritual life is taken by the mere utterance of them. The
motives which actuate the utterer are taken for granted;
the existence of such a set of the spiritual nature to God
as Deuteronomy demands is supposed to be proved by
the mere spoken words; and men who cannot or will not
say such things glibly are unchurched without mercy.
What is that but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opus operatum</i> in its most offensive
shape? But in whatever shape it appears, the Deuteronomic
demand for love to God, with the heart and soul
and strength, as essential to all true spiritual service
and sacrifice, condemns it. Love to God and men are
the main things in true religion. All else is subordinate
and secondary. Sacrifice and ritual without these are
dead forms. That is the Deuteronomic teaching, and by
it, once for all, the true relation of the cultus to the life
is fixed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the priestly and sacrificial system of the
Old Testament has even for Christians a present importance,
for it is an adumbration of that which was to be
done in the death of Christ. It has an unspeakable value,
when rightly used, as an object-lesson in the elements
which are essential to a right approach to a Holy God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
on the part of sinful men. Even in heathenism there
were such foreshadowings; and nothing is more fitted to
exalt our views of the Divine wisdom than to trace, as
we can now do, the ways in which man's seekings after
God, even beyond the bounds of the chosen people, took
forms that were afterwards absorbed and justified in the
redeeming work of our Blessed Lord. For example, Professor
Robertson Smith says of certain ancient heathen
piacular sacrifices, "The dreadful sacrifice is performed, not
with savage joy, but with awful sorrow, and in the mystic
sacrifices the deity himself suffers with and for the sins
of his people and lives again in their new life." Now if
we admit that he is not unduly importing into these
sacrifices ideas which are really foreign to them, surely
awe is the only adequate emotion wherewith a believer
in Christ can meet such a strange prophecy, in the lowest
religion, of that which is deepest in the highest.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The
sacrificial system in general was founded, in part at least,
on belief in the possibility and desirability of communion
with God. In the sacrificial feasts this was supposed to
be attained, and the essential religious needs of mankind
found expression in much of the ritual. If the death
of the god, and his returning to life again in his people
found a prominent place in piacular sacrifices in various
lands, that suggests that in some dim way even heathen
men had learned that sin cannot be removed and forgiven
without cost to God as well as to man, and that communion
in suffering as well as in joy is a necessary
element of life with God. The human heart, Divinely
biassed, asserted itself in effort after such association with
Deity, and in the feeling that sin was that element in
life which it would make the highest demand upon the
Divine love to set effectively aside.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>
<p>But if such preparation for the fulness of the time
was going on in heathenism, if the mind and heart of
man, driven forward by Divinely ordered experience and
its own needs, could produce such forecasts in the ritual
of heathen religion, we surely must admit that the religious
ritual in Israel had an even more intimate connection with
that which was to come. For we claim that in guiding
the destinies of Israel God was, in an exceptional manner,
revealing Himself, that among them He established the
true religion, unfolded it in their history, and prepared as
nowhere else for the advent of Him who should make
real and objective the union of God and man. Here consequently,
if anywhere, we should expect to find the
permanent factors in religion recognised even in the
forms of worship, and the less permanent allowed to
fall away. We should also expect the ritual of the cultus
to grow in depth of meaning with time, and that it would
more and more recognise the moral and spiritual elements
in life. Finally, we should expect that it would be the
parent of conceptions rising above and beyond itself, and
more fully consonant with the revelation given by Christ
than anything in heathenism.</p>

<p>Now all these expectations would seem to have been
fulfilled; and it is reasonable to assume that those sacrificial
ideas which corresponded to the deepened consciousness
of sin, and synchronised apparently with the decay
of Israel's political independence, are rightly applied to the
elucidation of the meaning of Christ's death. Of course
mistakes may be and have been made in the application
of this principle; the most common being that of forcing
every detail of the imperfect and temporary provision into
the interpretation of the perfect and eternal. Sometimes,
too, the significance of the life and coming of Christ are
obscured by a too exclusive attention to His sacrificial
death. But the principle in itself must be sound, if Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
is in any sense to be regarded as the completion and
full development of the Old Testament religion. Besides
the immediate significance of sacrifice which the worshippers
perceived and by which they were edified, there was
another significance which belonged to it as a step in the
long progress which had been marked out for this people
in the Divine purpose. Regarded from that standpoint,
the sacrifices, and the ritual connected with them, had a
meaning for the future also, were in fact typical of the
final sacrifice which would need to be offered only once
for all. How much of this was understood by the men
of ancient Israel we have no means of knowing. Some,
doubtless, had a faint perception of it; but at its clearest
it was probably more a dissatisfaction with what they had,
leading them to look for some better sacrifice, than any
more definite understanding. But what they only dimly
guessed was, as we can now see, the inner meaning of
all; and it is perfectly legitimate to use both the provisional
and the perfected revelations to explain each other. On
these grounds the New Testament freely makes use of
the ancient ritual to bring out the full significance of the
sacrifice of Christ.</p>

<p>No doubt a different view has to be reckoned with.
Many say that the whole of this typical reference is
a begging of the question. In the infancy of mankind
sacrifice was a natural way of expressing adoration and of
seeking the favour of the gods. In the heathen world it
reached its highest manifestation in those piacular sacrifices
of which Robertson Smith speaks, but which nevertheless
were merely an outgrowth of Totemism. In Israel
sacrifice was taken up by the religion of Yahweh and
embodied in it. The spiritual forces which were at work
in that nation used it as a means whereby to express
themselves; and when Christ came to complete the revelation,
His purely ethical and spiritual work was unavoidably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
expressed in sacrificial terms. But that is no
guarantee that the essential thing in the work of Christ
was sacrifice. On the contrary, the sacrificial language
used about it is of no real importance. It is simply the
natural and unavoidable form of expression, in that place
and at that time, for any spiritual deliverance. In short,
had there been really nothing sacrificial in the death of
Christ, the religious meaning and significance of it would
have been expressed in sacrificial language, for no other
was available. Consequently the presence of such
language in the New Testament does not prove that the
sacrificial meaning belongs to its main and permanent
significance. The sacrificial idea, on this view of things,
belongs, both in Israel and in heathenism, to the elements
which Christianity superseded and did away with; and
it is consequently an anachronism to bring it in to
explain and elucidate anything done or taught under this
new dispensation.</p>

<p>But such a view is singularly narrow, and unjust to
the past. It surely is more honouring to both God and
man to suppose that the capital religious ideas of the
race, those ideas which have been everywhere present
and have been seen to deepen and refine with every
advance man has made, have permanent value. Moreover,
on any view, it is probable that in them the essential
religious needs of human nature have found expression.
If so, we should expect that they would in the end be
met, and that the perfect religion, when it did come, would
not ignore but satisfy the demand which the nature of
man and the providence of God had originated and combined
to strengthen. Further, it is the very essence of
the Scriptural view of Christ that He perfected and carried
to their highest power all the essential features in the
religious constitution of Israel. He <em>was</em> indeed the true
Israel, and all Israel's tasks fell to Him. As Prophet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Priest, and Messianic King alike, He excelled all His
predecessors, who were what they were only because they
had, in their degree, done part of the work which He was
to come to finish. Apart from the religion of the Old
Testament, therefore, Christ is unintelligible, and that,
in turn, without Him, has neither a progress nor a goal.
Belief in a Divine direction of the world would in itself
be sufficient to forbid the separation of one from the
other. If so, it will follow that the sacrificial idea is
essential to the interpretation of our Lord's work. That
idea grew in complexity with the growth of the higher
religion. It was at its deepest when religious thought
and feeling had done its most perfect work; and on every
principle of evolution we should expect that, instead of
disappearing at the next stage, it would, though transformed,
be more influential than ever. It is so if Christ's
death is regarded from the point of view of sacrifice;
whereas, if that is laid aside like a worn-out garment, it can
never have been anything anywhere but an excrescence
and a superstition. That has not been so; the essential
ideas connected with sacrifice, and forgiveness by means of
it, were lessons Divinely taught in the childhood of the
world, to prepare men to understand the Divinest mystery
of history when it should be manifested to the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3><i>LAWS AGAINST IDOLATROUS ACTS AND CUSTOMS</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xiii., xiv.</h4>


<p>Having thus set forth the law which was to crown
and complete the long resistance of faithful Israel
to idolatry, our author goes on to prohibit and to decree
punishment for any action likely to lead to the worship
of false gods. He absolutely forbids any inquiry into the
religions of the Canaanites. "Take heed to thyself that
thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these
nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise."
All that was acceptable to Yahweh was included in the
law of Israel, and beyond that they were on no account to
go in their worship. "What thing soever I command
you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add
thereto nor diminish from it." But it should be observed
that the inquiry here forbidden has nothing in common
with the scientific inquiries of Comparative Religion in our
time. Curiosity of that kind, supported by the motive of
discovering how religion had grown, was unknown at that
early age of the world, probably everywhere, certainly in
Israel. The only curiosity powerful enough to result in
action then was that which tried to learn how the ritual
might be made more potent in its influence over Yahweh
by gathering attractive features from every known religion.
That was one of the distinguishing characteristics of
Manasseh's reign. The Canaanite religions, the religions
of Egypt and Assyria, were all laid under contribution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and wherever there was a feature which promised
additional power with God or the gods, that was eagerly
adopted. Israel had lost faith in Yahweh, owing to the
successes of Assyria. In unbelieving terror men were
wildly grasping at any means of safety. They worshipped
Yahweh, lest He should do them harm, but they joined
with Him the gods of their foes, to secure if possible their
favour also. Inquiry into other religions, with the intent
of adopting something from them which would make either
Yahweh or the strange gods, or both, propitious to them,
was rife. Like the heathen population who had been
transported by Assyria into the territory of the ten tribes,
men "feared Yahweh, and served their graven images."
All that is here sternly condemned, and Judah is taught
to look only to the Divine commands for effective means
of approach to their God. The prohibition, therefore, does
not import mere fanatical opposition to knowledge. It is
a necessary practical measure of defence against idolatry;
and only those can disapprove of it who are incapable of
estimating the value which the true religion in its Old
Testament shape had and has for the world. To preserve
that was the high and unique calling of Israel. Any
narrowness, real or supposed, which this great task
imposed upon that people, is amply compensated for by
their guardianship of the spiritual life of mankind.</p>

<p>But if inquiry into lower religions was forbidden, there
could be nothing but the sternest condemnation for those
who had inquired, and then endeavoured to seduce the
chosen people. Deuteronomy, therefore, takes three typical
cases&mdash;first, seduction by one who was respected because
of high religious office, then seduction by one who had
influence because of close bonds of natural affection, and
lastly that of a community which would be likely to have
influence by force of numbers&mdash;and gives inexorably stern
directions how such evil is to be met. There can be little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
doubt that the cases are not imaginary. In the evil days
which the Deuteronomist had fallen upon they were probably
of frequent occurrence, and they are, consequently,
provided against as real and present evils. Naturally the
writer takes the most difficult case first. If an Israelite
prophet, with all his religious prestige as a confidant of
Yahweh, and still more with the prestige of successful
prediction in his favour, shall attempt to lead men to join
other gods to Yahweh in their worship&mdash;for that and not
rejection of Yahweh for the exclusive service of strange
gods is almost certainly meant&mdash;then they were not to
listen to him. They were to fall back upon the original
principle of the Mosaic teaching as it was restated in
Deuteronomy, that Yahweh alone was to be their God.
Some lynx-eyed critics have discovered here the cloven
hoof of legalism. They think they see here the free spirit
of prophecy, to which untrammelled initiative was the very
breath of life, subjected to the bondage of written law,
and so doomed to death. But probably such a mood is
unnecessarily elegiac. It is not to written law that prophecy
is subjected here. It is the actual life-principle of
Yahwism in its simplest form which prophecy is required
to respect; that is, ultimately, it is called upon simply to
respect itself. Its own existence depended upon faithfulness
to Yahweh. If it had a mission at all, it was to
proclaim Him and to declare His character. If it had
a distinction which severed it from mere heathen soothsaying,
it was that it had been raised by the inspiration
of Yahweh into the region of "the true, the good, the
eternal," and its whole power lay in its keeping open the
communication with that region. It is therefore only
the law of its own inner being to which prophecy is here
bound; and the people are instructed that, whatever
reputation or even supernatural power it might have
attained to, it was to be obeyed only when true to itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and to the faith. Nothing was to make men stagger from
that foundation. Not even the working of miracles was
to mislead the people, for only on the plane of Yahweh's
revelation had even miracle any worth. This is the sound
and wholesome doctrine of true prophecy, and other
utterances on the subject in our book must be taken in
conjunction with it. Religious faithfulness, not foretelling,
is the essence of it, and by that the prophet is to be
inexorably judged. If any prophet, therefore, leads men
to strange gods, his character and his powers only make
him more dangerous and his punishment more inexorable.
"That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
death." He comes under the ban. "So shalt thou put
away the evil from the midst of thee."</p>

<p>Similarly, when family ties and family affection are
perverted to be instruments of seduction, they are to be
disregarded, just as religious reputation and miraculous
power were to be set aside. If a brother, or a son, or a
daughter, or a wife, or a friend, shall secretly entice a man
to "serve other gods," then he shall not only not yield,
but he must slay the tempter. It is characteristic of the
Deuteronomist that, by the qualifications of the various
relationships he mentions, he should show his sympathy
and his insight into the depths of both family affection
and friendship. "Thy brother, the son of thy mother,"
"the wife of thy bosom," "the friend which is as thine
own soul," even these, near as they are to thee, must be
sacrificed if they are false to Israel and to Israel's God.
Nay more, "Thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall
be upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the
hand of all the people, and thou shalt stone him with
stones that he die." Upon him, too, the ban shall be
laid.</p>

<p>Nor, finally, shall their multitude shield those who
suffered themselves to be perverted. If a city should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
have been led away by sons of Belial, i.e. by worthless
men, to worship strange gods, then the whole city was
to be put to the ban. It was to be immediately stormed,
every living creature put to death, and all the spoil of it
burnt "unto Yahweh their God"; and the ruins were to
be a "mound for ever"&mdash;that is, a place accursed. Only
on these terms could Yahweh be turned away from the
fierceness of His anger at such treason and unfaithfulness
among His people. The Canaanites had been condemned
to death that their idolatries and vices might not
corrupt the spiritual faith of Israel. There was no other
way, if the treasure which had been committed to this
nation was to be preserved. As Robertson Smith has
said, "Experience shows that primitive religious beliefs
are practically indestructible except by the destruction
of the race in which they are engrained." But if so, it
was perhaps even more necessary that idolaters within
Israel should be also extirpated. We may think the
punishment harsh; and our modern doctrines concerning
toleration can by no ingenuity be brought into harmony
with it. But the times were fierce, and men were not
easily restrained. In more civilised communities excessive
severity in punishment defeats itself, for it enlists
sympathy on the side of the criminal. But among a
people like the Hebrews, probably severity succeeded
where mercy would have been flouted. In India our
administrators have had to confess that the horrible recklessness
and severity of punishment in the Mahratta
states of the old type suppressed crime as the infinitely
more just and better organised but milder British police
organisations could not then do. "Probably the success
of barbarous methods of repressing crime is best explained
by their origin in and close connection with a
primitive state of society. Because punishments were
inhuman, they struck terror where no other motive would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
deter from crime."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In other and Scriptural words, the
hardness of men's hearts made such harshness unavoidable.</p>

<p>Taking the whole of this thirteenth chapter into consideration,
therefore, we see how high and severe were the
demands which Old Testament religion, as taught in
Deuteronomy, made upon its votaries. It presupposes on
the part of the people an insight into the fundamentally
spiritual nature of their faith entirely unobscured by ritual
and sacrifice. They were expected to pass beyond the
teachings of accredited spiritual guides, beyond even the
evidence of supernatural power, and to test all by the
moral and spiritual truth, once delivered to them by
prophet and by miracle, and now a secure possession.
Spiritual truth received and lived by is thus set above
everything else as the test and the judge of all. Other
things were merely ladders by which men had been
brought to the truth in religion. Once there, nothing
should move them; and any further guidance which purported
to come from even the heavenly places was to be
tried and accepted, only if it corroborated the fundamental
truths already received and attested by experience in
actual life. Loyalty to ascertained truth, that is, is greater
than loyalty to teachers, or to that which seems to be
supernatural; and the chief power for which a prophet
is to be reverenced is not that by which he gives a true
forecast of the future, but that which impels him to speak
the truth about God.</p>

<p>Even at this day, and for believers in Christ, after all
the teaching and experience of eighteen Christian centuries,
this is a high, almost an unattainable, standard to
set up. Even to-day it is thought an advanced position
that miracles as a security for truth are subordinate and
inferior to the light of the truth itself as exhibited in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
lives of faithful men. Yet that is precisely what the
Deuteronomist teaches. He has no doubt about miracles.
He regards them as being Divinely sent, even when they
might be made use of to mislead; but he calls upon his
people to disregard them if they seem to point towards
unfaithfulness to God. Their supreme trust is to be that
Yahweh cannot deny Himself. If he seem to do so by
giving the sanction of miracle to teaching which denies
Him, that is only to prove men, to know whether they
love Yahweh their God with all their heart and with all
their soul. The inner certainty of those who have had
communion with Yahweh is to override everything else.
"Whosoever loves God with a pure heart," says Calvin,
"is armed with the invincible power of the Divine Spirit,
that he should not be ensnared by falsehoods."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> This
has always been the confidence of religious reformers who
have had real power. Luther, for example, took his
stand upon the New Testament and his own personal
experience; and by what he <em>knew</em> of God he judged all
that the most venerable tradition, and the authority of
the Church, and the examples of saintly men claimed to
set forth as binding upon him. "Here stand I: I can
do no other: God help me." He felt that he had hold
of the heart of the revelation of God as it was made in
Christ, and he rejected, without scruple, whatever in itself
or in its results contradicted or obscured that. Inspired
and upheld by this consciousness, he faced a hostile
world and a raging Church with equanimity. It is always
so that abuses have been removed and innovations that
are hurtful warded off in the Church of God.</p>

<p>But there is a difficulty here. As against the historical
examples which show how much good may be wrought
by this unshaken mind when accompanied by adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
insight, many, perhaps even more, instances can be adduced
where unbending assertion of individual conviction
has led to fanaticism and irreligion; or, as has even more
frequently been the case, has blinded men's eyes, and
made them resist with immovable obstinacy teachings on
which the future of religion depended. On the altar of
uncompromising fidelity to the letter of the faith delivered
to them, men in all ages have offered up love and gentleness
and fairness, and that open mind to which alone
God can speak. How then can they be sure, when they
disregard their teachers and defy even signs from heaven,
that they are really only holding up the banner of faith
in an evil day, and are not hardening themselves against
God? The answer is that, since the matter concerns
the spiritual life, there are no clear, mechanical dividing
lines which can be pointed out and respected. Nothing
but spiritual insight can teach a man what the absolutely
essential and the less essential elements of religion are.
Nothing else can give him that power of distinguishing
great things from small which here is of such cardinal importance.
Probably the nearest approach to effective guidance
may be found in this principle, that when all points in
a man's faith are to him equally important, when he frets
as much in regard to divergence from his own religious
practices as in regard to denial of the faith altogether, he
must certainly be wrong. Such a temper must necessarily
resist all change; and since progress is as much a law in
the religious life as in any other, it must be found at
times fighting against God. Otherwise, stagnation would
be the test of truth, and the principles of the Christian faith
would be branded as so shallow and so easily exhausted,
that their whole significance could be seized and set
forth at once by the generation which heard the apostles.
That was far from being the case. The post-apostolic
Church, for instance, did not understand St. Paul. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
turned rather to the simpler ideas of the mass of Christians,
and elaborated its doctrines almost entirely on that basis.
During the centuries since then many lessons of unspeakable
value have been learned by the Christian world.
The Church has been enriched by the thoughts and
teachings of multitudes of men of genius. The providential
chances and changes of all these centuries have
immensely widened and deepened Christian experience.
Stagnation consequently cannot be made the test of
Christian truth. We must be open to new light on the
meaning of Divine revelation, or we fail altogether, as the
Israelites would have done had they refused to accept the
teaching of any prophet after the first. This much may,
however, be said on the affirmative side, that when a
man has thoughtfully and prayerfully decided that the
central element of his faith is attacked, he cannot but
resist, and if he is faithful he will resist in the spirit of
the passage we are discussing. His assertion of his
individual conviction, even if it be mistaken, will do little
harm. Time will be in favour of the truth. But mistake
will be rare, indeed, when men are taught to assert
in this manner only the things by which the soul lives,
when only the actual channels of communion with God
are thus defended to the uttermost. These any thoughtful
patient man who looks for and yields to the guidance of
the Holy Spirit of Christ will almost infallibly recognise,
and by these he will take his stand, for he can do no
other.</p>

<p>But precautions against idolatry are not exhausted by
the war declared upon men who might attempt to lead
the Israelite into evil. Besides insidious human enemies,
there were also insidious customs originating in heathenism,
and still redolent of idolatry even when they were severed
from any overt connection with it. Ancient rituals,
ancient superstitions, hateful remnants of bloodthirsty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
pagan rites, were being revived in the Deuteronomist's
day on every hand, because faith in the higher religion
that had superseded them had been shaken. Like streams
from hidden reservoirs suddenly reopened, idolatrous and
magical practices were overflowing the land, and were
finding in popular customs, harmless in better days,
channels for their return into the life of those who had
formerly risen above them.</p>

<p>Some of these were more hurtful than others, and two
are singled out at the beginning of chapter xiv. as those
which a people holy unto Yahweh must specially avoid:
"Ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness
between your eyes for the dead." The grounds for avoiding
these practices are first given, and we may probably
assume that they are the grounds also for the other
enactments which follow. They are these: "Ye are the
children of Yahweh your God," and "Thou art a holy
people unto Yahweh thy God, and Yahweh hath chosen
thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself, out of all
peoples that are upon the face of the earth." The last
of these reasons is common to the Exodus code with
Deuteronomy, and comes even more prominently into
view in the Levitical law. Just as Yahweh alone was to
be their God, they alone were to be Yahweh's people, and
they were to be holy to Him, <i>i.e.</i> were to separate themselves
to Him; for in its earliest meaning to be holy is
simply to be separate to Yahweh. This whole dispensation
of law, that is, was meant to separate the people of
Israel from the idolatrous world, and in this separation
we have the key to much that would otherwise be hard
to comprehend. Looked at from the point of view of
revelation, petty details about tonsure, about clean and
unclean animals, and so on, seem incredibly unworthy;
and many have said to themselves, How can the God of
the whole earth have really been the author of laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
dealing with such trivialities? But when we regard these
as provisions intended to secure the separation of the
chosen people, they assume quite another aspect. Then
we see that they had to be framed in contrast to the
idolatries of the surrounding nations, and are not meant to
have further spiritual or moral significance.</p>

<p>But the first reason given is a higher and more important
one, which occurs here for the first time in
Deuteronomy: "Ye are the children of Yahweh your
God." In heathen lands such a title of honour was
common, because physically most worshippers of false
gods were regarded as their children. But in Israel,
where such physical sonship would have been rejected
with horror as impairing the Divine holiness, the spiritual
sonship was asserted of the individual much more slowly.
In Yahweh's command to Moses to threaten Pharaoh
with the death of his firstborn son, and in Hosea xi. 1,
Israel collectively is called Yahweh's firstborn and
His son. In Hosea i. 10 it is prophesied that in the
Messianic time, "in the place where it was said unto them,
Ye are not My people, it shall be said unto them, Ye are
the sons of the living God." But here for the first time
this high title is bestowed upon the actual individual
Israelites. It was perhaps implied in the Deuteronomist's
view of God's fatherly treatment of the nation in the desert,
and still more in his demand for the love of the individual
heart. Yet only here is it brought plainly forth as
a ground for the regulation of life according to Yahweh's
commands. Each son of Israel is also a son of God; and
by none of his acts or habits should he bring disgrace
upon his spiritual Father. Likeness to God is expected
and demanded of him. It is his function in the world to
represent Him, to give expression to the Divine character
in all his ways. This is the Israelite's high calling, and
the religious application of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noblesse oblige</i> to such matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
as follow, gives a dignity and importance to all of them
such as in their own nature they could hardly claim.</p>

<p>"Ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness
between your eyes for the dead." Israel was not to
express grief for the dead in these ways, first because
that was the custom of other nations, and secondly still
more because the origin and meaning of such rites was
idolatrous, and as such altogether unworthy of Yahweh's
sons. "Both," says Robertson Smith, "occur not only
in mourning, but in the worship of the gods, and belong
to the sphere of heathen superstition."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Elsewhere he
explains the cutting of themselves to be the making of
a blood covenant with the dead, just as the priests of
Baal in their worship tried to get their god to come to
their help by making a covenant of blood with him
at his altar.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This naturally tended to bring in the
superstitions of necromancy, and opened the way also for
the worship of the dead. Many traces of its previous
existence among the Israelite tribes are to be found in
the Scriptures; and the probability is that as ancestor-worship
ruled the life and shaped the thoughts of Greeks
and Romans till Christianity appeared, so Yahwism alone
had broken its power over Israel. But such superstitions
die hard, and in the general recrudescence of almost forgotten
forms of heathenism at this time, this cult may very
well have been reasserting itself. As for the shaving of the
front part of the head, that had a precisely similar import.
"It had exactly the same sense as the offering of the
mourner's blood."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> "When the hair of the living is deposited
with the dead, and the hair of the dead remains with
the living, a permanent bond of connection unites the two."</p>

<p>The prohibition as food of the animals and birds called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
"unclean" was another measure obviously of the same
nature as the prohibition of heathen mourning practices;
but in its details it is more difficult to explain. Probably,
however, it was a more potent instrument of separation
than any other. In India to-day the gulf between
the flesh-eater and the orthodox vegetarian Hindu is
utterly impassable; and in the east of Europe and in
Palestine, where the Jewish restrictions as to food are
still regarded, the orthodox Jew is separated from all
Gentiles as by a wall. In travelling he never appears
at meals with his fellow-travellers. All the food he
requires he carries with him in a basket; and at every
place where he stops it is the duty of the Jewish community
to supply him with proper food, that he may not be
tempted to defile himself with anything unclean. But
it is very difficult for us now to bring the individual
prohibitions under one head, and it seems impossible to
explain them from any one point of view.</p>

<p>Some of the animals and birds prohibited were probably,
then, animals eaten in connection with idolatrous
feasts by the neighbouring heathen. Isa. lxv. 4 shows
that swine's flesh was eaten at sacrificial meals by
idolaters, and from the expression "broth of abominable
things is in their vessels" it is clear that the flesh of
other animals was so used. All these would necessarily
be prohibited to Israel; but beyond a few, such as the
swine, which was sacrificed to Tammuz or Adonis, and
the mouse and the wild ass, we have no means of knowing
what they were. That this is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vera causa</i> of such
prohibitions is shown by the facts mentioned by Professor
Robertson Smith, that "Simeon Stylites forbade his
Saracen converts to eat the flesh of the camel, which was
the chief element in the sacrificial meals of the Arabs,
and our own prejudice against the use of horse-flesh is
a relic of an old ecclesiastical prohibition framed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
time when the eating of such food was an act of worship
to Odin." The very ancient and stringent prohibition
of blood as an article of diet is probably to be accounted
for in this way also. Blood was eaten at heathen
sacrificial feasts; without other reason that would be
sufficient. These are the general lines which must have
determined the list of clean animals in the view of the
lawgiver, since he brings them in under the head of
idolatry and under the two general grounds we have
discussed (p. 289, <i>supra</i>).</p>

<p>Jewish writers, however, especially since Maimonides,
have regarded these prohibitions as aiming primarily at
sanitary ends, and as a proof of their efficacy have adduced
the unusually high average health of the Jews, and their
almost complete exemption from certain classes of disease.
No such point of view is suggested in the Scriptures
themselves, for it would surely be rather farfetched to
class possible disease as an infringement of the holiness
demanded of Israel, or as a thing unworthy of Yahweh's
sons. Nevertheless a general view of the list of clean
animals here given would support the idea that sanitary
considerations also had <em>something</em> to do with the classification.
The practical effect of the rule laid down is to
exclude all the <em>carnivora</em> among quadrupeds, and so far
as we can interpret the nomenclature, the <em>raptores</em> among
birds.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> "Amongst fish, those which were allowed contain
unquestionably the most wholesome varieties." Further,
the nations of antiquity which developed such categories
of clean and unclean animals seem in the main to have
taken the same line. The ground of this probably is the
natural disgust with which unclean feeders are always
regarded. Animals and birds especially which feed, or
may be supposed to feed, on carrion, are everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
disliked, and as a rule they are unsuitable for food.
Grass-eating animals, on the other hand, are always
regarded as clean. Scaleless fish, too, are generally more
or less slimy to the touch, and with them reptiles are altogether
forbidden. All this seems to show that a natural
sentiment of disgust, for whatever reason felt, was active
in the selection of the animals marked unclean by men of
every race. The pre-Mosaic customary law on this subject
would, of course, have this characteristic in common
with similar laws of primitive nations. When the worship
of Yahweh was introduced, most of this would be taken
over, only such modifications being introduced as the
higher religion demanded. In some main elements,
therefore, the Mosaic law on this subject would be a
repetition of what is to be found elsewhere. Hence a
general tendency to health may be expected; for besides
the guidance which healthy disgust would give, a long
experience must also have been registered in such laws.
The influence of them in promoting health has recently
been acknowledged by the <cite>Lancet</cite>; and though that reason
for observing them is not mentioned in Scripture, we may
view it as a proof that the Jewish legislators were under
an influence which brought them, perhaps even when they
knew it not, into relation with what was wholesome in
the practices and customs of their place and time.</p>

<p>Beyond these three reasons for the laws regarding
food, all is the wildest speculation. If other reasons
underlie these laws, we cannot now ascertain what they
were. For a time it was the custom to ascribe the Jewish
laws to Persian influence, though from the nature of the
case such laws must have been part of the heritage of
Israel from pre-Mosaic time. Even to-day Jewish writers
ascribe them to the evil effect which bad food has upon
the soul, either by infecting it with the characteristics of
the unclean beasts, or by rendering it impenetrable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
good influences.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> But, as usual, it is the allegorical interpreters
who carry off the palm. Animals that chew the
cud were to be eaten, because they symbolised those who
"read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest" the Divine law:
those which divide the hoof are examples of those who
distinguish between good and bad actions; and in the
ostrich one interpreter finds an analogue to the bad
commentators who pervert the words of Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>Hitherto in chapter xiv. we have been dealing with
material to which a parallel can be found only in the small
code of laws contained in Lev. xvii.-xxvi., commonly
called the Law of Holiness, and in the Priestly Code.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> But
the two remaining directions regarding food, which are
contained in the twenty-first verse are parallel to prohibitions
in the Law of the Covenant. The first, "Ye shall not
eat of anything that dieth of itself ... for thou art an holy
people unto Yahweh thy God," is parallel to Exod. xxii. 31.
"And ye shall be holy men unto Me: therefore ye shall
not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field," and to
Lev. xvii. 15, "Every soul that eateth that which dieth
of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be
homeborn or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and
bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
The ground for prohibiting such food, was, of course, that
the blood was in it. But there is a divergence between
the parallel laws, which is seen clearly when we take
into account the destination of the flesh of the animal
so dying. In Exodus it is said, "To the dogs shall ye
cast it." In Deuteronomy the command is, "To the
stranger within thy gates ye shall give it, and he shall
eat of it, or ye may sell it unto a foreigner." In Leviticus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
it is taken for granted that an Israelite and also a stranger
may eat either of the <i>nebhelah</i>, that which dieth of itself,
or the <i>terephah</i>, that which is torn; and if either do so
it is prescribed only that he should wash, and should be
unclean until the evening.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, we have one of the cases in which the
traditional hypothesis&mdash;that the Law of the Covenant was
given at Sinai when Israel arrived there, the laws of the
Priestly Code probably not many weeks after, and the
code of Deuteronomy only thirty-eight or thirty-nine years
later, but before the laws had come fully into effect by the
occupation of Canaan&mdash;raises a difficulty. Why should
the Sinaitic law say that <i>terephah</i> is not to be eaten by
any one, but cast to the dogs, and the Levitical law in so
short a time after make the eating of that and <i>nebhelah</i>
mere cause of subordinate uncleanness to both Israelite
and stranger, while Deuteronomy permits the Israelite
either to give the <i>nebhelah</i> to the stranger that he may
eat it, or to make it an article of traffic with the foreigner?
Keil's explanation is certainly feasible, that in Exodus we
have the law, in Leviticus the provision for accidental,
or perhaps wilful, disobedience of it under the pressure
of hunger, while in Deuteronomy we have a permission
to sell, lest on the plea of waste the law might be ignored.
But the position of the "<i>gƒìr</i>," or stranger, is not accounted
for. In Leviticus he is bound to the worship of
Yahweh, and can no more eat <i>nebhelah</i> or <i>terephah</i> than
the native Israelite can, while in Deuteronomy he is on
a lower stage than the Israelite as regards ceremonial
cleanness, and much on the same level as the <i>nokhri</i>, the
foreigner, who in Deuteronomy is dealt with as an inferior,
not bound to the same scrupulosity as the Israelite
(Deut. xv. 3, 23, 29). There does not appear to be any
explanation of such a change in less than forty years;
more especially as the moment at which the change would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
on that hypothesis be made was precisely the moment
when the stranger was about for the first time to become
an important element in Israelite life. If, on the other
hand, the order of the codes be Exodus, Deuteronomy,
Leviticus, then the Exodus law, which does not consider the
stranger, would suit the earliest stage of Israel's history,
when the stranger would generally be a spy. Later, he
crept into Israelite life, and gradually received more and
more consideration; especially in the days of Solomon,
when the Chronicler estimates the number of the strangers
at over a hundred and fifty thousand. But he was not
recognised at that stage as fully bound to all an Israelite's
duties, or as possessed of all an Israelite's privileges, and
that is precisely the position he occupies in Deuteronomy.
In the Priestly Code, however, at a time when the stranger
had practically become a proselyte, the ideal Kingdom of
God includes the "stranger," and gives him a position which
differs little from that of the homeborn. That would make
these different laws answer to different periods of Israel's
history, and would coincide with what has been otherwise
found to be the order of Israel's legal development.</p>

<p>The second prohibition, which runs parallel to what
we find in Exodus, is the somewhat enigmatical one
that a kid should not be sodden in its mother's milk.
What it was in this act which made it seem necessary
to issue such a command cannot now be ascertained with
any certainty. Most probably it was connected in some
way with heathen ceremonies, perhaps at a harvest feast;
for, as we have seen, it is a ruling motive throughout all
this section that the Israelites should reject everything
which among their neighbours was connected with
idolatry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><i>THE SPEAKERS FOR GOD&mdash;I. THE KING</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xvii. 14-20</h4>


<p>In approaching the main section of the legislation it
will be necessary, in accordance with the expository
character of the series to which this volume belongs, to
abandon the consecutive character of the comment. It
would lead us too far into arch√¶ology to discuss the
meaning and origin of all the legal provisions which
follow. Moreover nothing short of an extensive commentary
would do them justice, and for our purpose we
must endeavour to group the prescriptions of the code,
and discuss them so. As it stands there is no arrangement
traceable. So utterly without order is it, that it can
hardly be thought that it is in the exact shape in which
it left its author's hands. Transpositions and misplacements
must, one thinks, have taken place to some extent.
We are thus left free to make our own arrangements, and
it would appear most fitting to discuss the code under the
five heads of National Life, Economic Life, and three
fundamental qualities of a healthy national life&mdash;Purity,
Justice, and the Treatment of the Poor. Every phase of
the laws which remain for discussion can easily be brought
under these heads, and this chapter will discuss the first
of them, the organisation of the national life.</p>

<p>It is a striking instance of the accuracy of the national
memory that there is a clear and conscious testimony to
the fact that for long there was no king in Israel. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the later historians been at the mercy of a tradition so
deeply influenced by later times as it pleases some critics
to suppose, it would seem inexplicable that Moses should
not have been represented as a king, and especially that
the conquest should not have been represented as a king's
work. Evidently there was a perfectly clear national
consciousness of the earlier circumstances of the nation,
and it presents us with an outline of the original constitution
which is very simple and credible. According to this
the tribes whom Moses led were ruled in the main by
their own sheikhs or elders. Under these again were
the clans or fathers' houses similarly governed; and lastly,
there were the families in the wider sense, made up of
the individual households and governed by their heads.
So far as can be gathered, Moses did not interfere with
this fundamental organisation at all. He added to it only
his own supremacy, as the mediator and means of communication
between Yahweh and His people. As such,
his decision was final in all matters too difficult for the
sheikhs and judges. But the fundamental point never
lost sight of was that Yahweh alone was their ruler, their
legislator, their leader in war, and the doer of justice
among His people. From the very first moment of
Israel's national existence therefore, from the moment
that it passed the Red Sea, Yahweh was acknowledged
as King, and Moses was simply His representative. That
is the cardinal fact in this nation's life, and amid all the
difficulties and changes of its later history that was always
held to. Even when kings were appointed, they were
regarded only as the viceroys of Yahweh. In this way
the whole of the national affairs received a religious colour;
and those who look at them from a religious standpoint
have a justification which would have been less manifest
under other circumstances.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, no delusion of later times which finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
in Israelite institutions a deep religious meaning. Nor is
the persistence with which the Scriptural historians regard
only the religious aspects of national life to be laid as a
fault to their charge. It is nothing to the purpose to say
that the bulk of the people had no thoughts of that kind,
that the whole fabric of the national institutions appeared
to them in a different light. We have no right to lower
the meaning of things to the gross materialism of the
populace. One would almost think, to hear some Old
Testament critics speak, that in this most ideal realm of
religion we can be safe from illusion only when ideal
points of view are abandoned, that only in the commonest
light of common day have we any security that we are
not deceiving ourselves. But most of these same men
would resent it bitterly if that standard were applied to
the history of the lands they themselves love. What
Englishman would think that Great Britain's career and
destiny were rightly estimated if imperial sentiment and
humanitarian aims were thrust aside in favour of purely
material considerations? Why then should it be supposed
that the views and opinions of the multitude are
the only safe criterion to be applied to the institutions
of God's ancient people?</p>

<p>In truth, there is no reason why we should think so.
The Divine kingship made it impossible that the higher
minds should be content with the low aims of the opportunists
of their day, whether these were of the multitude
or not. Even the entrance into Canaan, which to the
mass of the people was, in the first place, a mere
acquisition of territory and wealth, was idealised for the
leaders of the people by the thought that it was the land
promised by Yahweh to their fathers, the land in which
they should live in communion with Him. Generally, it may
be said that the desire for communion with God was the
impelling and formative power in Israel. The thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of even the dullest and most earthly were touched by that
ideal at times; and no leader, whether royal, or priestly,
or prophetic, ever really succeeded among this people
who did not keep that persistently in view as the true
goal of his efforts. Moreover this gave its depth of
meaning to the whole movement of history in Israel.
Every triumph and defeat, every lapse and every reform
had, owing to this direction of the people's efforts, a
significance far beyond itself. These were not merely
incidents in the history of an obscure people; they were
the pulsations and movements of the world's advance to
the full revelation of God. All that would have been
wholly national or tribal in the institutions and arrangements
of an ordinary people was in Israel lifted up into
the religious sphere; and the orders of men who spoke
for the invisible King&mdash;the earthly king, the priest, and
the prophet&mdash;became naturally the organs of the national
life.</p>

<p>The king's position was entirely dependent upon
Yahweh. He was to be chosen by Yahweh, he was to
act for Yahweh, and no king could rightly fill his place
in Israel who was not loyal to that conception. It is in
this sense that David was the man after God's own heart.
He, in contrast to Saul and to many of the later kings,
accepted with entire loyalty, notwithstanding his great
natural powers, the position of viceroy for Yahweh. It
is, therefore, an essential truth which underlies the
Scriptural judgment that the kings who made themselves,
or attempted to make themselves, independent of Yahweh,
were false to Israel and to their true calling. And this
is why Samuel, when the people demanded a king,
regarded the movement with stern disapproval, and why
he received an oracle denouncing the movement as a
falling away from Yahweh. For, in the first place, the
motive for the people's request, their desire to be like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
other nations, was in itself a rejection of their God. It
repudiated, in part at least, the position of Israel as His
peculiar people, and implied that an earthly king would
do more for them than Yahweh had done; whereas if
they had been faithful and united enough in spirit they
would have found victory easy. In the second, the
request in itself was a confession of unfitness for their
high national calling; it was a confession of failure under
the conditions which had been Divinely appointed for
them. Not only in the eyes of the Biblical historian
therefore, but as a plain matter of fact, the demand was an
expression of dissatisfaction on the people's part with their
invisible King. They needed something less spiritual than
Yahweh's invisible presence and the prophetic word to
guide them. But since they had declared themselves thus
unfaithful, Yahweh had to deal with them at that level,
and granted their request as a concession to their unbelief
and hardness of heart.</p>

<p>That is the representation of the Books of Samuel; and
the absence of any similar law from the codes before
Deuteronomy confirms the view that the earthly kingship
was not an essential part of the polity of Israel, but a
mere episode. Nowhere in legislation save here in
Deuteronomy is the king ever mentioned, and nowhere,
not even here, is any provision made for his maintenance.
No civil taxes are appointed by any law, while the most
ample provision is made for the presentation direct to
Yahweh, as Lord paramount, of tithes and firstfruits.</p>

<p>The history and the law alike agree therefore in regarding
the kingship as somewhat of an excrescence upon
the national polity; and this law, where alone the king's
existence is recognised, confines itself strictly to securing
the theocratic character of the constitution. He must be
chosen by Yahweh; he must be a born worshipper of
Yahweh, not a foreigner; and he must rule in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
with the law given by Yahweh. Further, the ideal
Israelite king must be on his guard against the grossly
voluptuous luxury which Oriental sovereigns have never
been able to resist, either in ancient or modern times; and
also against the lust for war and conquest which was the
ruling passion of Assyrian and Egyptian kings. Evidently
too the ideal king of Israel was, like Bedouin sheikhs now,
expected to be rich, able to maintain his state out of his
own revenues. The tribute paid by subject peoples,
together with the booty taken in war and the profits of
trade, were his only legitimate sources of income beyond
his own wealth. Every other exaction was more or less
of an oppression. He had no right to make any claims
upon the land, for that was held direct of Yahweh. Nor
were there any regular taxes, so far as the Old Testament
informs us. The only approach to that would appear to
be that the presents with which his subjects voluntarily
approached the king were sometimes and by some rulers
made permanent demands; at least that would seem to be
the meaning of the somewhat obscure statement in 1 Sam.
xvii. 25 that King Saul would reward the slayer of
Goliath by making "his father's house free in Israel."
Some kind of regular exaction from which the victorious
champion's family should be free must here be referred
to; but it would not be safe, in the absence of all other
evidence, to suppose that regular taxes in the modern
sense are referred to. More probably something of the
nature of the "benevolences" which Edward IV. introduced
into England as a source of revenue is meant. If
a popular and powerful king of Israel was in want of
money, he could always secure it by ordering those able
to afford handsome presents to appear yearly before him
with such gifts as a loyal subject should offer. For the
convenience of all parties an indication of how much
would be expected might be made, and then he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
have what to all intents and purposes would be a tax.
Along with this he might also enforce the <i>corv√©e</i>; but
such things were always regarded as excesses of despotic
power. That Samuel in his <i>mishpat hammelekh</i> (1 Sam.
viii. 15) warns the people that the king would demand of
them a tithe of their cereal crops and of the fruit of their
vineyards and of their sheep, does not contradict this
reading of the passage in 1 Sam. xvii. For though
chapter viii. belongs to the later portion of 1 Samuel and
may therefore represent what the kings had actually
claimed, yet it in no way endorses such demands. On
the contrary, it indicates that such exactions would bring
the people into slavery to the king by the phrase "And
ye shall be to him for slaves." All that is mentioned
there, consequently, is part of the evil the kingship would
bring with it, and cannot in any way be regarded as a
legal provision for the maintenance of royalty.</p>

<p>It is not probable, therefore, that in these prescriptions
the author of Deuteronomy is repeating a more ancient
law. No such law has come down to us. Dillmann
supposes the provision that the king should always be
an Israelite to be ancient; and indeed at first sight it
is difficult to see why such a provision should be introduced
for the first time in the last days of the Southern
Kingdom, where the kingship had so long been confined,
not only to Israelites, but to the Davidic line. But
Jer. xxxii. 21&mdash;"Their potentate shall be of themselves,
and their governor shall proceed from the midst of
them"&mdash;shows that, whatever the cause might be, there
was in the first years of the sixth century a longing for
a native king similar to that here expressed. In any case,
as the obvious intention here is to make entire submission
to Yahweh the condition of any legitimate kingship,
it was only consistent to require expressly that the
king should be one of Yahweh's people. That motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
would be quite sufficient to account for raising what had
been the invariable practice into a formulated law; and
no other of the prescriptions need have been ancient.
On the other hand, the curious phrase "Only he shall
not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to
return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply
horses; forasmuch as Yahweh hath said unto you, Ye
shall henceforth return no more that way," can hardly
belong to the Mosaic time. There was no doubt then
much danger that the people should wish to return to
Egypt; but that a king should cause them to return
for horses, is too much of a subordinate detail to have
been portion of a Mosaic prophecy. If, as is most probable,
the phrase condemns the sending of Israelites
into Egypt to buy horses and chariots, it can have been
written only after Solomon's days. Before that time
Israel, as an almost exclusively mountain people, regarded
horses and chariots with dislike, and usually destroyed
them when they fell into their hands. With the extension
of their power over the plains and the growth of a
lust for conquest, they sought after chariots eagerly. To
procure them they entered into alliances with Egypt which
the prophets denounced, and which brought to the nation
nothing but evil. It was natural, therefore, that the
Deuteronomist should specially mention this detail, and
should support it by reference to a Divine promise, which
does not appear in our Bible, but which probably was
found in either the Yahwistic or the Elohistic narrative.</p>

<p>But whether the whole is Deuteronomic or not, there
can be no question that the command that the king shall
have "a copy of this law" prepared for him and shall
read constantly therein is so; and perhaps of all the prescriptions
this is the most important. In purely Eastern
states there is no legislature at all, and the greater
part of the criminal jurisdiction especially is carried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
without any reference to fixed law save in cases affecting
religion. This was the case in the Mahratta states in
India so long as they were independent. The ruler and
the officers he appointed administered justice, solely
according to custom and their own notions of rectitude,
"without advertence to any law except the popular notions
of customary law."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Now in Israel the state of things was
entirely similar, save in so far as the fundamental principles
of Yahwistic religion had been formulated. In all other
respects customary law ruled everything. But it was the
religious influence that gave its highest and best developments
to the life of Israel. It was this, too, which brought
to such early maturity in Israel the principles of justice,
mercy, and freedom. Elsewhere these were of exceedingly
slow growth. In Israel, the influence of the lofty
religious ideas implanted in the nation by Moses did for
them what the influence of the higher political and social
ideas of the governing Englishmen are said to do, under
favourable circumstances, for the Indian peoples. Without
disturbing the general harmony which must subsist between
all parts of the organism of the State if the nation's
life is to be healthy, and without putting it out of relation
with its surroundings, that influence has been, and is
still, moving the more backward Indian societies along
the natural paths of human progress at a greatly accelerated
speed.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In a similar way the Israelite people was moved
by the Mosaic influence, in its aspirations at least, with an
elsewhere unexampled speed and certainty, towards an
ideal of national life which no nation since has even
endeavoured to realise. But whenever the kings threw
off the yoke of Yahweh and plunged into idolatry, then
the evils of despotic Oriental rule made their appearance
unchecked. These evils have been enumerated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
following words by one well acquainted with Oriental
states: "Cruelty, superstition, callous indifference to the
security of the weaker and poorer classes, avarice, corruption,
disorder in all public affairs, and open brigandage."
With the exception perhaps of the last, these are precisely
the sins which the prophets are continually denouncing.
Long before Hezekiah they were rampant, especially in
the Northern Kingdom, and in the evil days between
Hezekiah and Josiah, when we suppose Deuteronomy to
have been written, they were indulged in without shame
or compunction.</p>

<p>The result was that an inarticulate cry, like that we
hear to-day from Persia in the articulate form of newspaper
articles, must have filled the hearts of all righteous men
and the multitude of the oppressed. What it would be
we may learn from the following extract from a letter
written from Persia to the <i>Kamin</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "Law," a Persian
newspaper published in London, and translated by
Arminius Vamb√©ry in the <cite>Deutsche Rundschau</cite> for
October 1893: "Oh, brothers, behold how deeply we
have sunk into the sea of ignominy and shame. Tyranny,
famine, disease, poverty, calamity, decay of character, and
all the misery in the world has overflowed our country.
The cause of all this misfortune lies in this, that we have
no laws; only in this, that our conscienceless and foolish
great ones have wilfully and purposely rejected, trodden
under foot, and destroyed the laws of the sacred code....
We are men, and would have laws! It is not
new laws we ask for, but we desire that our secular and
spiritual heads should assemble and press for the enforcement
of the holy laws of the sacred code. Therefore we
ask of you this one thing, that you should proclaim: 'We
are men, and would have laws.'" The East is so perennially
the same, that the two thousand five hundred years
which separate that pathetic cry from the prayers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
true Israel in Manasseh's and Amon's days make no
radical difference. The situation was the same, and the
need was the same. Hence came this prophetic and
priestly redaction of the Law of the Covenant. "They
were men, and would have laws." They sought to be
freed from the greed, the cruelty, and the lawlessness
of their rulers; and having produced their revised code,
they wished to secure that it should not disappear from
memory, as the more ancient law had been suffered to do.
It must be kept continually before the king's mind. "It
shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days
of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God,
to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to
do them." In this way it was thought that future "great
ones" would be prevented from "rejecting, treading under
foot, and destroying the laws of the sacred code."</p>

<p>But the king of Israel was not only to be a law-abiding
and a law-enforcing king. He was to learn from this new
law even a deeper lesson. He was to read daily in the
law, "that his heart might not be lifted up above his
brethren." Oriental despots either openly claim that they
are of higher and purer blood than their subjects, or they
deal with these latter as if they had nothing in common
with them. In the laws of Manu it is said, "Even an
infant king must not be despised, (from an idea) that he is
a (mere) mortal; for he is a great deity in human form."
It was not to be so in Israel. His subjects were the
Israelite king's "brethren." They all stood in the same
relation to their God. All equally had shared Yahweh's
favour in being delivered from the bondage of Egypt.
Each had the same rights, the same privileges, the same
claims to justice and consideration as the king himself had.
That, this law was to teach the king; and when he had
learned the lesson, it is taken for granted that the root
from which the other evils spring would be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, then, the ruler of Israel was to be. He was to
feel, first of all his responsibility to God. Then he was
to deny himself to the lust of conquest, to the voluptuous
pleasures of the flesh, to the most devouring lust of all,
the love of money. Last of all, and above all, he was to
acknowledge his equality with the poorest of the people
in the sight of God. Could there be even yet a nobler
ideal set before the kings of the world than this? The
reign of only one king of Israel, Josiah, promised its
realisation. That seemed, indeed, to be "the fair beginning
of a time." But it was not so; it proved to be only
an afterglow, a mere prelude to the night. None of his
successors made even an attempt to imitate him, and the
destruction of the Jewish State put an end to all hope of
the appearance of the Yahwistic king in Israel. Elsewhere,
before the coming of Christ, he did not appear.
Since Christ's coming, here and there, at rare intervals,
such rulers have been found. But in the East perhaps
the only rulers who can be said to have made any
attempt in this direction are the best of the great
uncrowned kings of India, the British viceroys.</p>

<p>Such, for example, was Lord Lawrence's aim, and his
reward. From the beginning to the end of his Indian
career he lived a pure and simple life, laboured with
untiring energy for the good of the people, and kept in
his mind, as his aspirations for his Punjaub peasantry
show, the Old Testament ideal of both ruler and ruled.
He was, too, entirely free from the lust of conquest, as
some Indian viceroys have not perhaps been; and he did
all his work under a solemn sense of responsibility to
God. To a large extent, the Biblical ideal made him what
he was as a ruler, and the life and power of that ideal
now, in such men, sufficiently show the truth of the
prophetic and priestly insight which is embodied here.
Many who have disregarded these rules have done great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
things for the world; but we are only the more sure, after
two thousand five hundred years, that on these lines alone
can the ruler attain his highest and purest eminence. All
the aspirations of men to-day are towards a state of things
in which rulers, whether they be any longer kings or no,
shall stand on a level of brotherhood with their subjects,
and shall set the good of the ruled before them as their
sole aim. All men are dreaming now of a future in
which personal ambition shall have little scope, in which
none will be for himself or for a party, but "all will be
for the State." If ever that good dream be realised,
rulers of the Deuteronomic type will be universal; and
the depth of wisdom embodied in the laws of this
small and obscure Oriental people, so many ages ago,
will be manifested in a general political and social happiness
such as has never yet been seen, on any large scale
at least, in the history of men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><i>SPEAKERS FOR GOD.&mdash;II. THE PRIEST</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xviii. 1-8</h4>


<p>The priesthood naturally follows the kingship in the
regulations regarding the position of the governing
classes. But it was an older and much more radical
constituent in the polity of Israel than we have seen the
kingship to be. Originally, the priests were the normal
and regular exponents of Yahweh's will. They received
and gave forth to the people oracles from Him, and they
were the fountain of moral and spiritual guidance. The
Torah of the priests, which on the older view was the
Pentateuch as we have it, or its substance at least, which
Moses had put into their hands, is much more probably
now regarded as the guidance given by means of the sacred
lot and the Urim and Thummim. Because of their special
nearness to and intimacy with God, the priests were in
contact with the Divine will and could receive special
Divine guidance; and in days when the voice of prophecy
was dumb, or in matters which it left untouched, the
priestly Torah, or direction, was the one authorised Divine
voice. But this was not the only function of the priests.
Sacrificial worship was a more fundamental function.
Wellhausen and his school indeed seem inclined to deny
that as priests of Yahweh they had any Divinely ordered
connection with sacrifice. But the truer view is that their
power to give Torah to Israel depended entirely upon
their being the custodians of the places where Yahweh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
had caused His name to be remembered. The theory
was that, as they approached Him with sacrifices in
His sanctuaries, they consequently could speak for Him;
so that the guarding of His shrines, and the offering of
the people's sacrifices there were their first duties. In
fact they were the mediators between Yahweh and Israel.
Yahweh was King, but He was invisible, and the priests
were His visible earthly representatives. The dues,
which in a merely secular state would have gone to the
king, as rent for the lands held of him, were employed for
their appointed uses by the priests, as the servants and
representatives of the heavenly King who had bestowed
the land upon Israel and allotted to each family its portion.
Occupying a middle position, then, between the
two parties to the Covenant by which Israel had become
Yahweh's chosen people, they spoke for the people when
they appeared before Yahweh, and for Him when they
came forth to the people. They were, as we have said,
the oldest and most important of the ruling classes, and
must have been from early times a special order set
apart for the service of Israel's God.</p>

<p>The main passages in Deuteronomy which bear upon
the position and character of the priesthood and of the
tribe of Levi are the following. In chaps. xviii. 1-8, x.
6-9, and xxvii. 9-14 the strictly priestly functions of the
tribe of Levi are dealt with; in xvii. 9 ff. xix. 17, the
judicial functions; in xxi. 1-5 their function in connection
with sanitary matters is referred to. Besides these there
are the various injunctions to invite the Levites to the
sacrificial feasts, because they have no inheritance, and
a number of references to the priesthood as a well-known
body, the constitution and duties of which did not
need special treatment. These last are of themselves
sufficient to prove beyond question that in dealing with
the priests and Levites the author of this book writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
from out of the midst of a long established system.
He does not legislate for the introduction of priests,
neither does he refer to a priestly system recently
elaborated by himself, and only now coming into operation.
He does not tell us how priests are to be appointed,
nor from whom, nor with what ceremonies of consecration
they are to be inducted into their office. In fact
the writer speaks of what concerns the priests and
Levites in a manner which makes it certain that in his
day there were, and had long been, Levites who were
priests, and Levites of whom it may at least be said that
they were probably nothing more than subordinates in
regard to religious duty. In a word, while presupposing
an established system of priestly and Levitical service, he
nowhere attempts to give any clear or complete view of
that system. His whole mind is turned towards the people.
It is about their duties and their rights he is anxious,
about their duties perhaps more than their rights; and he
touches upon matters connected with others than the
people only in a cursory way. In this matter, especially,
he clearly needs to be supplemented by information drawn
from other sources, and his every word about it shows
that he is not introducing or referring to anything new.
Any modifications he makes are plainly stated and are
limited to a few special points.</p>

<p>The chief passage for our purpose is, however, xviii. 1-8,
where we have the agents of the cultus defined, and
directions for the dues to be given them. In ver. 1 these
agents are clearly said to be the whole tribe of Levi; for
the phrase "The priests, the Levites, the whole tribe
of Levi," cannot mean the priests and the Levites who
together make up the whole tribe of Levi. Notwithstanding
the arguments of Keil and Curtiss and other ingenious
scholars, the unprejudiced mind must, I think, accept
Dillmann's rendering, "The Levitical priests, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
tribe of Levi," the latter clause standing in apposition to
the former. In that case Deuteronomy must be held to
regard every Levite as in some sense priestly. This view
is confirmed by x. 8 f., where distinctly priestly duties are
assigned to the "tribe of Levi." Some indeed assert
that this verse was written by a later editor, but valid
reasons for the assertion are somewhat difficult to find.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Neither Kuenen nor Oettli nor Dillmann find any. We
may, then, accept it as Deuteronomic since critics of such
various leanings do so. To quote Dillmann, "Beyond
question, therefore, the tribe as a whole appears here as
called to sacred, especially priestly service; only it does
not follow from that that every individual member of the
tribe could exercise these functions at his pleasure, without
there being any organisation and gradation among
these servants of God." No, that does not follow; and
this very passage (Deut. xviii. 1-8) shows that it does not,
for it makes a very clear distinction. In vv. 3 ff. the dues
of the priest are dealt with, while in vv. 6 ff. those of the
Levite in one special case are provided for. As if to
emphasise the distinction between them, the priest in
ver. 3 is not called "Levitical," as he is in other passages.</p>

<p>Further, the verses concerning the Levite also emphasise
the distinction; for few will be able to adopt the view that
here in vv. 6 ff. every Levite who chooses is authorised
to become a priest, by the mere process of presenting
himself at the central sanctuary. The author of Deuteronomy
must have known, better probably than any one
now considering this matter, that the priests in the central
sanctuary would never consent to divide their privileges
and their income with every member of their tribe who
might choose to come up to Jerusalem. Indeed, if they
had received each and every one, the crowd would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
been an embarrassment instead of a help. As a matter of
fact, when the Deuteronomic reform came to be put in
practice, this free admission of every Levite to the service
of the Jerusalem Temple was not adopted, and it is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</i> improbable that the author of it can have meant his
provision in that sense. The meaning seems to be that,
as only those Levites who were employed in the central
sanctuary could be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i> priests, those living in the
country were not priests in the same sense; and the
regulation made is that if any Levite came up to Jerusalem
and was received into the ranks of the Temple Levites, <i>i.e.</i>
the sacrificial priests, he should receive the same dues as
the others performing the same work did. But though
no conditions of admission to the Temple service are
mentioned, obviously there must have been some conditions,
some division of labour, some organisation involving
gradations in rank, and perhaps also some limitation as
to time in the case of such voluntary service as is here
dealt with. For, as Dillmann points out, it is not said
that the service of every Temple Levite is the same;
numbers of them may have had no higher work than the
Levites under the laws of the Priest Codex.</p>

<p>Moreover the other functions assigned to the priests
confirm the argument, and prove that in the time of
Deuteronomy distinctions of rank among the Levites must
have been firmly established. They had a place in the
public justiciary, even in the supreme court, "in the
place which Yahweh their God" had chosen (Deut. xvii. 9,
xix. 17). Not only so, the law concerning a man found
slain in chap. xxi., vv. 1-5, implies that there were in
the cities throughout the land priests, the sons of Levi,
whom "Yahweh thy God hath chosen to minister unto
Him and to bless in the name of Yahweh, and according
to their word shall every controversy and every stroke
be." Now it cannot possibly have been the intention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the author of Deuteronomy that every member of the tribe
of Levi should have equal power to decide such matters.
If in his view every Levite was a priest, then we should
have this impossible state of affairs, that the highest courts
for judicial process should be in the hands of a class which
was more largely indebted to the generosity of the rich
for its maintenance than any other in the country. It
seems plain therefore that every Levite could not exercise
<em>full</em> priestly functions because of his birth. Clearly, if
any Levite might become a priest it was only in the same
sense in which every Napoleonic soldier was said to carry
a marshal's baton in his knapsack.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in this passage (ver. 5), by the words "him and
his sons for ever," which refer back to "the priest," a
hereditary character of the priesthood is asserted. This
phrase is remarkably parallel to that so frequently used
by P, "Aaron and his sons"; and though we are not told
in what family or families the priesthood was hereditary,
it must have been so in some. But in x. 6, 7, the family
of Aaron is mentioned by the Deuteronomist as having
hereditary right to the priesthood at the central shrine.
There can therefore be no doubt that in the time of the
author of Deuteronomy priesthood was hereditary, perhaps
in several families, but certainly in the family of Aaron.</p>

<p>The remaining point in these verses of chap. xviii. is
the dues. As the whole tribe had no land, so the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
tribe had a share in the dues paid by the people to their
Divine King. In vv. 3 ff. we have a statement of what
these were. The whole tribe of Levi are to eat "the
offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and His inheritance.
And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren:
Yahweh is their inheritance, as He hath spoken unto
them." The only place in Scripture in which such a
promise is given is Numb. xviii. 20, 24, so that these
passages, if not referred to by the author of Deuteronomy,
must be founded upon a tradition already old in his time.
As the servants of Yahweh, the Levites were to be
wholly Yahweh's care; as His representatives, they were
to use for the supply of their needs all such portions of
the offerings made to Him by fire as were not to be
consumed on the altar. Their remaining provision was
to be "His," <i>i.e.</i> Yahweh's, "inheritance," or rather
"portion," or that which belongs to Him. Now Yahweh's
"portion" consisted of all the other sacred dues (besides
the sacrifices) which should be paid to Yahweh, such as
the tithes, the firstlings, and the firstfruits. On these the
whole tribe of Levi was to live, and so be free to give
their time to the special business of the sanctuary, and
to related duties, in so far as they were called upon.</p>

<p>But there were to be distinctions. In vv. 3-5 we
have a special statement of what was to be paid by the
people to the priests, <i>i.e.</i> the sacrificing priests. Of every
animal offered in sacrifice, except those offered as whole
burnt-offerings, they were to receive "the shoulder, the
two cheeks, and the maw," all choice pieces. Further,
they were to receive the "firstfruits of corn, wine, oil,
and the first of the fleece of the sheep." For the priests
of one sanctuary these would be quite provision enough,
though the word translated "firstfruits," <i>rƒìshith</i>, is very
indefinite, and probably meant much or little, according
as the donor was liberal or churlish. But how does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
this agree with that which is bestowed upon the priests
according to the Priest Codex? In the passage
corresponding to this (Lev. vii. 31-34) the wave breast
and the heave thigh are the portions which are to be
bestowed upon "Aaron the priest and his sons, as a due
for ever from the children of Israel"; and where the firstfruits
are dealt with (Numb. xviii. 12 ff.) "the first of the
fleece of the sheep" is not mentioned. That is an addition
made by the author of Deuteronomy; but what of "the
shoulder, the two cheeks, and the maw"? Are they a
substitute for the "wave breast and the heave thigh," or
are they an addition? If we hold that the laws in the
Pentateuch were all given by Moses in the wilderness,
and in the order in which they stand, it will be most
natural to think that what we have here is meant to
be an addition to what Numbers prescribes. But if it
is established that Deuteronomy is a distinct work,
written at a different period from the other books of the
Pentateuch, then, though there is not sufficient evidence
to justify a dogmatic decision on either side, the weight of
probability is in favour of the supposition that the Deuteronomic
provision is a substitute, or at least an alternative,
for what we have in Numbers. The fact that the prescription
in Numbers is not repeated makes for that view, as
well as the fact that Deuteronomy does not as a rule tend
to increase the burdens on the people. Keil's view, that
Deuteronomy and Numbers are dealing with quite different
sacrifices, will hardly stand examination. He thinks that
the feasts at which the firstlings, turned into money, and
the third-year tithes were eaten, are referred to here,
while in Numbers it is the ordinary peace-offerings which
are dealt with. But the postponed firstlings were eaten
at the sanctuary, and would consequently come under
the head of ordinary sacrifices; and the third-year tithes
were eaten in the local centres, so that the bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of the priestly portions would be as difficult in this
case as in the case of the slaughterings for ordinary
meals, which Keil, partly for that reason, thinks cannot
be referred to here. On the whole, the best opinion
seems to be that Deuteronomy has here different prescriptions
from those in Numbers, and that probably
there is a considerable interval of time between the two.</p>

<p>In vv. 6-8 the Levite as distinguished from the priest
is dealt with, though by no means fully. Only in one
respect are special regulations given. When such an
one came to do duty at the central sanctuary, he was to
receive his share of the sacrifices with the rest.</p>

<p>In Chapter I. the main outlines of the Deuteronomic
system of priestly arrangements have been placed alongside
those of the Book of the Covenant and JE, and those
of P, with a view to decide whether they could all have
been the work of one lawgiver's life. Here they must be
compared in order that we may ascertain whether a view
of the development of the priestly tribe which will do
justice to these various documents and their provisions
can be suggested.</p>

<p>Some schools of critics offer the hypothesis that there
was no special priesthood till late in the time of the kings.
From the beginning, they say, the head of each household
was the family priest, and secular men, such as the kings,
and men of other tribes than the Levites, could be and
were priests, and offered sacrifice even at Jerusalem.
With Deuteronomy the tribe of Levi was established as
the priestly tribe, and only after the Exile was priesthood
restricted to the sons of Aaron. But this scheme does
justice to one set of passages only at the expense of another.
It accounts for all that is anomalous in the history,
and pushes aside the main and consistent affirmation of
all our authorities, that from the earliest days the tribe
of Levi had a special connection with sacred things and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
a special position in Israel. To what straits its advocates
are reduced may be seen in the fact that Wellhausen has
to declare that there were two tribes of Levi, one purely
secular that was all but destroyed in an attack upon
Shechem, and which afterwards disappeared, and a later
ecclesiastical and somewhat factitious tribe, or caste, which
"towards the end of the monarchy arose out of the
separate priestly families of Judah."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> A more improbable
suggestion than that can hardly be conceived.</p>

<p>But historical analogy, the favourite weapon of these
very critics, also condemns it. Let us look at the growth
of the priesthood in other ancient nations. In small and
isolated communities the head of the household was
generally the family priest, and in all probability this
was the case in the various separate tribes of which
Israel was composed; at least it was so in the households
of the patriarchs. But, in communities formed by
amalgamation of different tribes&mdash;and according to modern
ideas Israel was so formed&mdash;there was almost always
superinduced upon that more primitive state of things
another and different arrangement. In antiquity no bond
could hold together tribes or families conscious of different
descent, save the bond of religion. Consequently, whenever
such an amalgamation took place, the very first thing
which had to be done was to establish religious rites
common to the whole new community, which of course
were not the care of the heads of households as such.
Each separate section of the composite body kept up, no
doubt, the family rites; but there had to be a common
worship, and of course a special priesthood, for the new
community. This is sufficiently attested for the Greeks
and Romans by De Coulanges, who in his <cite>La Cit√©
Antique</cite> gathers together such a mass of authorities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
regard to this matter that few will be inclined to dispute
his conclusion. On page 146 he says: "Several
tribes might unite, on condition that the worship of each
was respected. When such an alliance was entered into,
the city or state came into existence. It is of little importance
to inquire into the causes which induced several
tribes to unite; what is certain is that the bond of the
new association was again a religion. The tribes which
grouped themselves to form a state never failed to light a
sacred fire, and to set up a common religion." But the
family and tribal rites continued to exist as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacra privata</i>,
just as the central government dominated but did not
destroy the family and tribal governments.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>It may be objected that these customs are proved only
for the Aryan races, and that, though proved for them,
they form no valid analogy for Semitic peoples. But
besides the fact that part of the statements we have
quoted are obviously true of Israel, we have a guarantee
that the principle enunciated is also valid for it. The
whole process traced in the religious progress of the
Aryan nations is based upon the worship of ancestors.
Now one of the critical discoveries is that ancestor-worship
was a part of the religion of the tribes which
afterwards united to form the Israelite nation. Some, like
Stade, tell us that that was the early religion of Israel
itself. In that form the theory is, I think, to be rejected;
but there would seem to be little doubt that, before the
birth of the nation, ancestor-worship was much practised
by the Hebrew tribes. If so, we may quite safely take
over the analogy we have established, and believe that
when Moses united the tribes into a nation, the religion
of Yahweh was the absolutely necessary connecting link
which bound them together. For though the tribes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
related, and are represented as the descendants of Abraham,
they must have varied considerably from each other in
religious beliefs and usages. By Moses these variations
were extinguished, as far as that was possible, by the
establishment of an exclusive Yahweh-worship as the
national cult; and to carry on this, not the heads of
households, but a priesthood that represented the nation,
must have been selected. But if so, who would most
naturally be selected for this duty? A sentence from De
Coulanges will show that in this case the tribe of Levi
would almost necessarily be chosen. Speaking of cases
in which a composite state relieved itself of the trouble
of inventing a new worship by adopting the special god
of one of the component tribes, he says: "But when
a family consented to share its god in this fashion it
reserved for itself at least the priesthood." Now if that
was the case in Israel, the priesthood of the tribe of Levi
would at once become a necessity. Whether Yahweh
had been ever known to the other tribes or not, there can
be little doubt that the knowledge of Him which made
them a nation and started them on their unique career of
spiritual discovery came from the Mosaic tribe, and family.</p>

<p>The God whom the family worshipped became the God of
the confederacy, and they would be the natural guardians
of His sanctuary. This would not in the least involve
special sanctity and meekness on the part of the tribe, as
some insist. They would remain a tribe, like the others;
but their leading men would discharge the functions
of priests for the confederated nation. It is difficult,
indeed, to see why any one else should have been
thought of: most likely the arrangement was made as a
thing of course.</p>

<p>But if there was such a common worship, there must
have been a sanctuary for it, and at it the Levitic priests
must have discharged their functions. Now though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Tabernacle, as P knows it, is not spoken of either in JE or
in Deuteronomy, a "tent of meeting" at which Jehovah
revealed Himself to Moses and to which the people went
to seek Yahweh (Exod. xxxiii. 7 ff.) is known to all our
authorities. Further, Wellhausen himself says, "If Moses
did anything at all he certainly founded the sanctuary at
Qadesh and the Torah there, which the priests of the ark
carried on after him," so that even he recognises the
necessity we have pointed out. From the days of Moses
onwards, therefore, there must have been special priests
of Yahweh, a special Yahwistic sanctuary, ritual with a
special sacrifice presented to Yahweh, and lastly a central
oracle, which is precisely what the passages explained
away by Wellhausen assert. But of course at that early
time, even if the ultimate purpose was to have an exclusively
Levitical priesthood, concessions to the old state of
things would have to be made. The Passover was left
in the hands of the household priest, and in other ways
probably he would be considered. The old order would
insist on surviving, and the rigour of the later arrangements
cannot then have been attained. In other respects
we know that it was so; and we may well believe that
the priesthood of the individual householder and of the
rulers was tolerated, and as far as possible regulated, so
as to offer no public scandal to the religion of Yahweh.
So, among the Homeric Greeks special hereditary priesthoods
coexisted with a political priesthood of the head of
the State, and with the household priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The laxity on these points ascribed to Moses is, however,
less than has been supposed. At Mount Sinai
he certainly did appoint the "young men of the children
of Israel"<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> to slaughter the beasts for sacrifice; but
he reserved for himself, a Levite, the sprinkling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
blood on the altar.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> He also made Joshua his servant,
an Ephraimite, the keeper of the sanctuary; but even
under the Levitical law, a priest's slave was reckoned to
be of his household and could eat of the holy things.
These were not very great laxities, and there is nothing
in them to make us suppose that a regular priesthood did
not exist from Sinai. Moreover, that a special place should
be assigned to Aaron and his sons was natural. He was
the brother of Moses, and would be the natural representative
of the tribe, since Moses was removed from it as
being leader of all. Everything therefore concurs to
confirm the Biblical view that the Levitic priesthood had
its origin at Sinai, and that at the chief sanctuary and
oracle the chief place in the priesthood fell to Aaron and
his sons. Worship at other sanctuaries was permitted,
and there the heads of households may have performed
priestly functions, or in later times in Canaan some other
Levitic families; but that there was a central sanctuary in
the hands of Levitic priests, among whom the family of
Aaron had a chief place, is what the circumstances, the historical
data we have, and all historical analogy alike demand.</p>

<p>For the discharge of their sacred functions certain dues
were doubtless assigned to the priests, and the Levites
sharing in the subordinate duties of the sanctuary would
share also in the emoluments. In other respects Levi in
the wilderness would differ in nothing from other tribes.
But in preparation for the arrival in Canaan, it was decreed
that Levi should "have no part or inheritance in Israel."
Yahweh was to be their inheritance.</p>

<p>The point to notice here is that this tribe was to retain
the nomadic life when the other tribes became agricultural.
The reason for it is plain. That ancient manner
of life was looked upon as superior in a religious aspect
to the agricultural life. In the first place, the ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
life of Israel had been of that kind. Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob had been heads of nomadic families or tribes;
and the pure and peaceful religious life, the intimate
communion with God which they enjoyed, always dominated
the imagination of the pious Israelite. Moreover
the fundamental revelation had come to Moses when
he was a shepherd in the waste. Further, the life of
the shepherd is necessarily less continuously busy than
that of the agriculturist; it has, therefore, more scope in
it for contemplation; and in many countries and at various
times shepherds have been a specially thoughtful, as
well as a specially pious class. But, perhaps the chief
reason was that the shepherd life was not only simple
and frugal in itself, but it was also by its very conditions
free from some of the greatest dangers to which the
religious life of the Israelite in Canaan was exposed.
When the bulk of the people adopted the settled life, they
were not only thrown among the Canaanites, but they
went to school them in all that concerned elaborate
agriculture. This necessarily made the intercourse and
connection between the two peoples extremely intimate,
and was fruitful in evil results. From this the semi-nomadic
portions of the people were to a great extent free,
and they would seem to have been regarded as the guardians
of a higher life and a purer tradition than others. They
represented to the popular mind the Israel of ancient days,
which had known nothing of the vices of cities, and in
which the pure uncorrupted religion of Yahweh had held
exclusive sway.</p>

<p>A remarkable narrative of the Old Testament establishes
this. When Jehu was engaged in his sanguinary suppression
of the house of Ahab, and the Baal-worship which
they had introduced, we read in 2 Kings x. 15 ff. that
he lighted on Jonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet
him. This Jonadab was the chief of the Rechabites, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
nomadic clan, who were bound by oath to drink no
wine, nor to build houses, nor sow seed, nor plant
vineyards, and to dwell in tents all their days (Jer.
xxxv. 6, 7). This was clearly intended as a protest against
the prevailing corruption of manners, and was founded on
a special zeal for the uncorrupted religion of Yahweh.
Recognising Jonadab's position as a champion of true
religion, Jehu anxiously seeks his approval and co-operation.
He says, "Is thine heart right, as my heart
is with thy heart?" And Jonadab answered, "It is."
"If it be," said Jehu, "give me thine hand." And he
gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the
chariot. And he said, "Come with me, and see my zeal
for Yahweh." At a much later time, Jeremiah, at the
Divine command, used the faithfulness of these nomads
to the ordinances of their chiefs to put to shame the
unfaithfulness of Israel to Yahweh's ordinances; and
promises (Jer. xxxv. 19) that because of it "Jonadab
the son of Rechab shall never want a man to stand before
Yahweh," <i>i.e.</i> as His servant. The Nazarites, again, were
in some measure an indication of the same thing. Their
rigorous abstinence from the fruit of the vine (the special
sign and gift of a settled life in a country like Palestine)
was their great distinguishing mark, as persons peculiarly
set apart to the service of God. Something analogous
is seen in that other desert faith, Mohammedanism. When
the great reformer, Abd-el-Wahab, attempted to bring back
Islam to its primitive power, he fell back largely upon the
simplicity of the desert life, though he did not insist upon
the abandonment of agriculture and fixed habitations.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not surprising that the priestly tribe
was kept to the nomadic life by the ordinance that they
should not have a portion in the distribution of the
Canaanite territory. But according to the narrative of
the attack upon Shechem by Levi and Simeon, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
verses in the blessing of Jacob (Gen. xlix.) dealing with
these tribes, the course of history reinforced this command.
Whether the treachery at Shechem occurred,
as the Genesis narrative places it, before the Exodus,
when Israel was only a family, or was an incident in the
history of the two tribes after Canaan had been invaded,
as many critics think,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the significance of it is that because
of an historical exhibition of fierce and intolerant zeal on
the part of Levi and Simeon, which the other tribes would
not defend, their settlement in that part of the land was
rendered difficult, if not impossible. Hence Simeon had
to seek other settlements, while Levi fell back to the
position assigned to it by its priestly character. It is not
a valid exception to this view&mdash;which reconciles the two
statements that Levi had no inheritance with the other
tribes because of its specially near relation to Yahweh,
and also because of its cruel treachery at Shechem&mdash;that a
priestly tribe is likely to have been not more, but rather less,
fierce than the others. That would entirely depend upon
the cause or occasion which called out the fierceness. In
all that concerned religion Levi would naturally be more
inclined to extreme measures than the other tribes, and
in this case the higher morality, secured by the separateness
of Israel, might easily appear to be at stake.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It is,
therefore, quite credible that the excessive vengeance taken
should have been planned mainly by Levi, and that the
resulting hatred should have broken up Simeon, and
driven back Levi with emphasis to its higher call.</p>

<p>In any case there never was again any doubt that the
Levites were to be excluded from the number of land-owning
tribes. Even in the legislation regarding the
forty-eight priestly cities this principle asserts itself.
The keeping of sheep and cattle on the pastures, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
were the only lands attached to these cities, was to be the
Levites' only secular occupation, and they were neither
to own nor work agricultural land. But to compensate
for any hardship this arrangement might bring with it, the
Levites, as the special servants of Yahweh, were to have
Him for their inheritance, <i>i.e.</i> as we have seen, the dues
coming to Yahweh were to become the property of the
Levites in great part. I say in great part, because the gift
to the Levites exclusively of a tithe of the income of the
people is thought by many to be only a late provision.</p>

<p>After Canaan had been conquered, the state of things
in connection with the priesthood would be something like
this. The tent with the ark would be the principal
sanctuary, served by a hereditary Levitic priesthood,
at the head of which would be a descendant of Aaron.
The tribe of Levi, being nomadic, would probably encamp
in the neighbourhood of the central sanctuary in part, and
recruits for the priestly work would be taken occasionally
from them, while other sections would gravitate to the
neighbourhood of other sanctuaries. As we see from the
story of Micah in Judges, it was considered desirable to
have a Levite for priest everywhere, and consequently
there would arise at all the High Places Levitic priesthoods,
most probably in part hereditary. But notwithstanding
their dues, the bulk of the tribe, being nomads,
would be looked upon by the agricultural population as
poor, just as the Bedouin, in Palestine now are, comparatively
speaking, very poor. This state of things would
correspond entirely with what Deuteronomy tells us; and
after that legislation the position of the Levites as a priestly
body would be more assured than ever. In the post-exilic
period all that had been regulated by practice in earlier
days found written expression. Differentiation of function
was minutely carried out. The priesthood was confined
rigorously to the Aaronic house, and the other Levites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
were given to them as attendants. In this way the whole
Levitic system was introduced, and with the exclusive
altar came the exclusive priesthood. So far as I can see,
it is only by some such hypothesis that justice can be done
to <em>all</em> the statements of Scripture; and considering the
elastic nature of Old Testament law, there is nothing
improbable in it. In any case there is an amount of
evidence of various kinds for the Mosaic origin of the
Levitic, and even the Aaronic priesthood, which no proof
of irregularities can overturn.</p>

<p>In the Divinely sanctioned arrangements of the Old
Testament Church, therefore, the existence of a body of
ecclesiastical persons, having little share in the ordinary
pursuits of their neighbours, and dependent upon their
clerical duties for a large part of their maintenance, was
deemed necessary to secure the continuity of worship and
religious belief. As has been already pointed out, the
priesthood was necessarily more conservative than progressive.
As an institution, it was suited rather to gather
up and perpetuate the results of religious movements
otherwise originated, than to originate them itself. But
in that sphere it was an absolutely necessary element in the
life of Israel. Difficult as it was to permeate the people
with the truths of revealed religion, it would have been
impossible without the services of the priestly tribe.
Wherever they went they were a visible embodiment of
the demand for faithfulness to Yahweh, and, with all their
aberrations, they probably lived at a higher spiritual level
than the average layman. As has been well said, though
Malachi had much reason to complain of the priests in his
own day, his estimate of what Levi had been in the past
is no exaggeration (ii. 6): "The law of truth was in his
mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he
walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn
many away from iniquity." But such a body as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Levites could not have been kept thus spiritually alive,
unless the members of it had lived somewhat aloof from
the strifes and envies of the market-place, and this they
could not have done had they not lived by their
sacred function. The prophets, under the power and
impulse of new truth adapted to their own time, did not
need this protection; consequently some of them were
called from ordinary secular work&mdash;from the plough, like
Elisha, or from the midst of the rich and highborn
inhabitants of Jerusalem, like Isaiah. If one may so say,
they were men of religious genius; while the bulk of the
priests and Levites must always have been commonplace
men in comparison. Yet even of the prophets a number
were trained in the nomadic life; others were priests who
were shut off also from agriculture. Clearly, therefore,
some measure of separation from the full pulsing life of
the world was, even in the most favourable circumstances,
helpful in developing religious character. For the ordinary
average ecclesiastic it was indispensable; and that he
should exist, and should live at as high a level as possible,
was as much a condition of Israel's discharge of her great
mission, as that the voice of the prophet should be heard
at all the great turning-points of her career.</p>

<p>The modern tendency in Old Testament study is to
depreciate the priest and to exalt the prophet, just as
in ecclesiastical life we tend to make much of those
who are or give themselves out to be religious reformers
and thinkers, and to make little of the ordinary parish or
congregational ministry. But the good done by the latter
is, and must be, for each individual generation more than
that done by the former. No one can estimate too highly
the conserving and elevating effect of a faithful high-minded
spiritual minister. Often without genius either
intellectual or religious, without much speculative power,
with so firm a hold of the old truth, which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
their own guiding star, that they cannot readily see
the good in anything new, such men, when faithful to
the light they have, are the stable, restful, immediately
effective element in all Church life. And such a body
can be best spiritualised by being separated somewhat
from the stress and strain of competition in the race of
life. Being what they are, the necessity of taking their
full part in the business of the world would inevitably
secularise them, to the great and lasting damage of all
spiritual interests. For though to modern students of
Old Testament religion, who are interested most in its
growth and progress towards its consummation in Christianity,
the prophet is by far the most interesting figure,
to the ancient people itself it must have seemed that the
priests and Levites, if they in any degree deserved
Malachi's eulogy, were the entirely indispensable element
in their religious life. They gave the daily bread of
religion to the people. They embodied the principles
which came to them from prophetic inspiration in
ceremonies and institutions; they treasured up whatever
had been gained, and kept the people nurtured in it and
admonished by it. In short, they prepared the soil and
cultivated the roots from which alone the consummate
flower of prophecy could spring; and when the voice of
prophecy was dying away they brought the piety of the
average Israelite to the highest point it ever reached.</p>

<p>In modern times the necessity for such a body of
special churchmen is challenged from two opposite sides.
There is, on the one hand, the body of over-spiritualised
believers who abhor organisation, and the machinery of
organisation, as if it were an intolerable evil. Conscious
very often of quick spiritual impulse and vivid life in
themselves, they fret against the slow movements of large
bodies of men; they separate themselves from all the
organised Churches and reject a regular ministry. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the Lord's people are now, under the Christian dispensation,
priests and prophets, they say, and a separate paid
ministry in sacred things they refuse to hear of. For
spiritual nourishment they rely solely upon the prophetic
gifts of their members, and are satisfied that thus they
are preparing the way for the universal prevalence of a
higher form of Church life. But, so far as can be judged,
their experiment has not prospered, nor is it likely to do
so. For these separatist Christians have found that
spiritual life, like other kinds of life, cannot express itself
without an organism. That implies organisation; and
though they do with less of it than other Christians,
still they are often driven into arrangements which really
bring back the regular ministry with its separate position;
and in other respects they are saved from the inconveniences
they have fled from, only by their want of
success. If their system ever became general, it would
necessarily drift into organisation, for only at that price
can any coherent, continuous, and lasting effect be
produced. Unfettered by the dull, the critical, and the
judicious, the impulsive and enthusiastic would always
be outrunning the possibilities of the present time. In
the interests of the best, they would be continually
ignoring or destroying the good. To prevent that, a
special body of religious men set apart for sacred services,
and freed from the rough struggle for existence so far as
a maintenance from funds devoted to religious purposes
can free them, is one of the best provisions known.
Where in the mass they are really religious men, they
secure that the pressure upward, which the Church exerts
upon the lives of its own members and upon the community
in general, shall be effective to the highest degree
then possible, and shall be exerted in the directions in
which such pressure will most fully answer to the needs
and aspirations of the time. Where, on the contrary, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
mass of them are secularised, they no doubt are a power
for evil; but the contrast between their profession and
their practice in that case is so shocking, that unless
they be supported by the "dead hand" of endowments
with no living spiritual demand behind them, they soon
sink by their own weight, to give place to a better type.
And even when they are thus supported, though unfaithful,
their calling in name at least remains spiritual, and sooner
than the other elements in the nation they are apt to be
stirred by breathings of a new life.</p>

<p>The other objectors to the regular ministry are those, in
the press and elsewhere, who demand of all ministers
that they should be prophets, or inspired religious
geniuses, and, because they are not, deny their right to
exist. According to this view every sermon that is not a
new revelation is a failure, every minister of the sanctuary
who is not a discoverer in religion is a pretender, every
one who only exemplifies and lives by the power of the
Gospel, as it was last formulated so as to lay hold upon
the popular mind, is an obscurantist. But no reasonable
man really believes this. Such reproaches are merely the
penalty which must be paid for claiming so high a calling
as that of an ambassador for Christ. No man can quite
adequately fill such a position; and the bulk of ministers
of Christ know better than others how much below their
ideal their real service is. But this also is true, that, take
them all in all, no class of men are doing anything like so
much as Christian ministers throughout the world are
doing to keep up the standard of morals and to keep alive
faith in that which is spiritual. We have no right to
complain that in their sphere they are conservative of that
which has been handed on to them. They have tried and
proved that teaching; they know that wherever it secures
a foothold it lifts men up to God, and they are naturally
doubtful whether new and untried teaching will do as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
much. They have pressing upon them, too, as others
have not, the interest of individual men and women whom
they see and know, men and women who for the most
part, and so far as they can see, are accessible to spiritual
impulse only on lines with which they are familiar;
and they dread the diversion of their thoughts from their
real spiritual interests, to matters which, for them at least,
must remain largely intellectual and speculative. No
doubt it would be well if all pastors could, as the most
highly endowed do, look beyond that narrower field; could
take account of the movements which are drifting men
into new positions, from which the old landmarks cannot
be seen and consequently exert no influence; and could
endeavour to rethink their Christianity from new points of
view, which may be about to become the orthodoxy of the
next generation. But no ministry will ever be a ministry
of prophets. It may even be doubted whether such a
ministry could be borne if it ever should arise. Under it
one might fear that spiritual repose and spiritual growth
would alike be impossible for the average man, in his
breathless race after teachers each of whom was always
catching sight of new lights. The mass of men need,
first of all, teachers who have firmly seized the common
truth by which the Church of their day lives, who live
conspicuously nearer the Christian ideal, as generally
conceived, than others do, who devote themselves in
sincerity and self-sacrifice to the work of making the
things that are most surely believed among Christians a
common and abiding possession. Such men need never
be ashamed of themselves or of their calling. Theirs is
the foundation work, so far as any attempt to realise the
Kingdom of God on earth is concerned; for without the
general acceptance of the truth attained which they bring
about, no further attainment would be possible. The
very environment out of which alone the prophet could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
developed would be wanting, and stagnation and death
would certainly and necessarily follow.</p>

<p>One other thing remains to be said. Though we have
taken these significant words of ver. 2&mdash;"And they shall
have no inheritance among their brethren: Yahweh is
their inheritance, as He hath spoken unto them"&mdash;in their
first and most obvious reference, it is not to be supposed
that that meaning has exhausted all that the words conveyed
to ancient Israel. The perpetuation of the nomadic
form of life among the Levites, and the bestowal of tithes
and sacrificial meats upon them, was undoubtedly the first
purpose of this command. But it had, even for ancient
Israel, a more spiritual meaning. Just as in the promise
of Canaan as a dwelling-place the spiritual Israelite never
regarded <em>merely</em> the gift of wealth and the prospect of
comfort,&mdash;Canaan was always for them Yahweh's land,
the land where they would specially live near Him
and find the joy of His presence,&mdash;so in this case the
spiritual gift, of which the material was only an expression,
is the main thing. To have Yahweh for their
heritage can never have meant <em>only</em> so much money and
provisions, so much leisure and opportunity for contemplation,
to any true son of Levi. Otherwise it is inexplicable
how the words used to indicate this very earthly thing
should have become so acceptable a formula for the deepest
spiritual experience of Christian men. It meant also a
spiritual bond between Yahweh and His servants&mdash;a special
nearness on their part, and a special condescension on
His. To the other tribes Yahweh had given His land,
to them He had given Himself as a heritage; and
though doubtless any unspiritual son of Levi must have
thought the tangible advantages of a fertile farm
more attractive than visionary nearness to God, the
spiritual among the Levites must have felt that they had
received the really good part, which no hostile invasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
no oppression of the rich, could ever take away. Their
ordinary life-work brought them more into contact with
sacred things than others. The goodness, the mercy, the
love of God were, or at least ought to have been, clearer
to them than to their brethren; and the joy of doing
good to men for God's sake, the rapture of contemplation
which possessed them when they were privileged to
see the face of God, must have made all the coarser
benefits of the earthly heritage seem worse than nothing
and vanity. Of course there was the danger that
familiarity with religious things should dull instead of
quickening the insight; and many passages in the Old
Testament show that this danger was not always escaped.
But often, and for long periods, it must have been warded
off; and then the superiority of God's gift of Himself
must have been manifest, not only to the chosen tribe, but
to all Israel. For the nature of man is too intrinsically
noble ever to be quite satisfied with the world, and the
riches and comforts of the world, for its inheritance. At
no time has man ever failed to do homage to spiritual gifts.
Even to-day, in spheres outside of religion, there are
multitudes of men and women who would put aside without
a sigh any wealth the world could give, if it were
offered as a substitute for their delight in poetry, or for
their power to rethink and re-enjoy the ideas of those
whose "thoughts have wandered through eternity." And
the power to follow and to yield oneself up to the thoughts
of the Eternal God Himself is a reward far above these.
To the faithful servant of God at all times and in all
lands that joy has been open, for God Himself has been
their heritage; and though in ancient Israel the beauty
of "Yahweh their God" was not quite unveiled, yet we
know from the Psalms that many penetrated even then
to the inner glory where God meets His chosen, and there,
though having nothing, yet found that in Him they had all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3><i>SPEAKERS FOR GOD&mdash;III. THE PROPHET</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xviii. 9-22</h4>


<p>The third of the Divine voices to this nation was the
prophet. Just as in the other Semitic nations round
about Israel there were kings and priests and soothsayers,
there were to be in Israel kings and priests and prophets;
and the first two orders having been discussed, there
remains for consideration the prophet, in so far at least
as he was to be the substitute for the soothsayer. That
this parallel was in the mind of the writer, and that he
probably intended only to deal with certain aspects of the
prophetic office, is witnessed by the fact that he introduces
what he has to say regarding the prophet by a stern and
detailed denunciation of any dealings with soothsayers
and wizards. In the earlier codes the same denunciation
is found, but the catalogue of names for those who practised
such arts is nowhere so extensive as it is here. In the
Book of the Covenant the <i>mekhashsheph</i>, or magician, alone
is mentioned (Exod. xxii. 17); while the peculiar code
which is contained in the last chapters of Leviticus,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> mentions
only five varieties of sorcerers. The Deuteronomic
list of eight is thus the most complete; and Dillmann may
be right in regarding it as also the latest. But the special
indignation of the writer of Deuteronomy against these
forms of superstition would be quite sufficient to account for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
his elaborate detail. If he lived in the days of Manasseh,
he would have before his eyes the passing of children
through the fire to Moloch. That was connected with
soothsaying and was the crowning horror of Israel's
idolatry. The author of Deuteronomy might, therefore,
well be more passionate and detailed in his denunciations
than others, whether earlier or later.</p>

<p>Nor let any one imagine that in this he was wrong and
unenlightened. Whether we believe in the occasional
appearance of abnormal powers of the soothsaying kind
or not, it is evident that in every nation's life there has
been a time in which faith in the existence of such powers
was universal, and in which the moral and spiritual life
of men has been threatened in the gravest way by the
proceedings of those who claimed to possess them. At
this hour the witch-doctor, with his cruelties and frauds,
is the incubus that rests upon all the semi-civilised or
wholly uncivilised peoples of Africa. Even British justice
has to lay hands upon him in New Guinea, as the following
extract from a Melbourne newspaper will show:
"Divination by means of evil spirits is practised to such
an extent and with such evil effects by the natives of
New Guinea that the Native Regulation Board of British
New Guinea has found it necessary to make an ordinance
forbidding it. The regulation opens with the statement,
'White men know that sorcery is only deceit, but the
lies of the sorcerer frighten many people; the deceit of
the sorcerer should be stopped.' It then proceeds to
point out that it is forbidden for any person to practise
or to pretend to practise sorcery, or for any person to
threaten any other person with sorcery, whether practised
by himself or any one else. Any one found guilty of
sorcery may be sentenced by a European magistrate to
three months' imprisonment, or by a native magistrate
to three days' imprisonment, and he will be compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
to work in prison without payment." Through the sorcerer
attempts at advance to a higher life are in our own day
being rendered futile; at his instigation the darkest crimes
are committed; and because of him and the beliefs he
inculcates men are kept all their lives subject to bondage.
So also of old. The ancient soothsayer might be an impostor
in everything, but he was none the less dangerous
for that. To what depths of wickedness his practices
can bring men is seen in the horrors of the secret
cult of the negroes of Hayti. Even when soothsaying
and magic were connected with higher religions than
the fetichism of the Haytian negro, they were still detrimental
in no ordinary degree. No worthy conception of
God could grow up where these were dominant, and
toleration of them was utterly impossible for the religion
of Yahweh.</p>

<p>The justice of the punishment of death decreed against
wizards and witches in Scripture was, therefore, quite
independent of the reality of the powers such persons
claimed. They professed and were believed to have
them, and thus they acquired an influence which was
fatal to any real belief in a moral and spiritual government
of the world. They must therefore be an "abomination"
to Yahweh; and as, in any case, by the very fact
that they were soothsayers and diviners they practised
low forms of idolatry, those who sought them must share
the condemnation of the idolater in Israel. In the earlier
days of the sacred history there was no enemy so subtle,
so insidious, so difficult to meet as magic and soothsaying.
Only by actual prohibition, on pain of death, could the
case be adequately met; and under these circumstances
there is no need for us to apologise for the Old Testament
law, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" (Exod. xxii.
17). What is aimed at here is the profession on the part
of any woman that she had and used these supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
powers. This was a crime against Israel's higher life.
The punishment of it had no resemblance to the judicial
cruelties perpetrated in comparatively modern times, when
the charge of being a witch became a weapon against
people, who for the most part were guilty only of being
helpless and lonely.</p>

<p>But it is characteristic of the large outlook of Deuteronomy
that not only is the evil protested against; the
universal human need which underlay it is acknowledged
and supplied. Behind all the terrible aberrations of
heathen soothsaying and divination the author saw hunger
for a revelation of the will and purpose of God. That
was worthy of sympathy, however inadequate and evil
the substitutes elaborated for the really Divine means
of enlightenment were. So he promises that the real
need will be supplied by God's holy prophets. Nothing
that savoured of ignorance or misapprehension of God's
spirituality, or of unfaithfulness to Yahweh, could be
tolerated; for Israel's God would supply all their need
by a prophet from the midst of them, of their brethren,
like unto Moses, in whose mouth Yahweh would put His
words, and who should speak unto them all that He
should command him. This is the broadest and most
general legitimation of the prophet, as a special organ of
revelation in Israel, that the Scripture contains. By it he
is made one of the regularly constituted channels of Divine
influence for his people. For it is evidently not one single
individual, such as the Messiah, who is here foretold. That
has been the interpretation received from the earlier Jews,
and cherished in the Church up till quite modern times.
But as Keil rightly says, the fact that this promise is
set against any supposed need to have recourse to diviners
and wizards, is in itself sufficient proof that the prophetic
order is meant. It was not only in the far-off Messianic
time that Israel was to find in this Divinely sent prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
that knowledge of God's will and purposes which it
needed. Israel of all times, tempted by the customs of
its heathen neighbours to go to the diviners, was to have
in Yahweh's prophet a continual deliverance from the
temptation. That implies that this <i>Nabhi</i>, or prophet like
unto Moses, was to be continually recurring, at every turn
and crisis of this nation's career.</p>

<p>Further, the direction in the end of the passage for
testing the prophets, whether they were really sent of God
or not, confirms this view. It would be singularly out
of place in a promise which referred to the Messiah in an
exclusive and primary fashion. He would never need
testing of this sort, for He was to be the realisation and
embodiment of Israel's highest aspirations. But if the
passage means to give the prophets a place among the
national organs of intercourse with Yahweh alongside of
the priests, the necessity of distinguishing these true and
Divinely given prophets from pretenders was urgent. The
context, both before and after the promise, seems, therefore,
to be decisively in favour of the general reference;
and the phrases "like unto me," "like unto thee," <i>i.e.</i>
Moses, when carefully examined, instead of weakening
that inference, strengthen it. They are not used here as
the similar phrase is used in Deut. xxxiv. 10: "And
there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto
Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face." There the
closeness of Moses' approach to Yahweh is the point in
hand, and it is clearly stated that in that regard Moses
was more favoured than any who had succeeded him.
But here the comparison is between Moses and the prophets,
in so far as mediation between Yahweh and His people
was concerned. At Israel's own wish Moses had been
appointed to hear the Divine voice. Israel had said "Let
me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God, neither
let me see this great fire any more, that I die not."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
The prophet here promised was to be like Moses in that
respect, but there is nothing to assert that he would be
equal to Moses in power and dignity. On all grounds,
therefore, the reference to the line of prophets is to be
maintained.</p>

<p>Still, the interpretation thus reached does not exclude&mdash;it
distinctly includes&mdash;the Messianic reference. If the
passage promises that at all moments of difficulty and
crisis in Israel's history, the will of God would be made
known by a Divinely sent prophet, that would be specially
true of the last and greatest crisis, the birth of the new
time which the Messiah was to inaugurate. Whatever
fulfilment the promise might receive previously to that,
it could not be perfectly fulfilled without the advent of
Him whose office it was to close up the history of the
present world, and bring all things by a safe transition
into the new Messianic world. That was the greatest
crisis; and necessarily the prophet who spoke for Yahweh
in it must be the crown of the long line of prophets.
There is still a higher sense in which this promise has
reference to the Messiah. He was to sum up and realise
in Himself all the possibilities of Israel. Now they were
the prophetic nation, the people who were to reveal God
to mankind; and when they proved prevailingly false to
their higher calling, the hopes of all who remained faithful
turned to that "true" Israel which alone would inherit
the promises. At one period, just before and in the
Exile, the prophetic order would appear to have been
looked upon as the Israel within Israel, to whom it would
fall to accomplish the great things to which the seed of
Abraham had been called. But the author of Second
Isaiah, despairing even of them, saw that the destiny of
Israel would be accomplished by one great Servant of
Yahweh, who should outshine all other prophets, as He
would surpass all other Israelite priests and Davidic kings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
As the crown and embodiment of all that the prophets
had aspired to be, the Messiah alone completely fulfilled
this promise, and consequently the Messianic reference
is organically one with the primary reference. They are
so intimately interwoven that nothing but violence can
separate them; and thus we gain a deeper insight into
the wide reach of the Divine purposes, and the organic
unity of the Divine action in the world. These form
a far better guarantee for the recognition of Messianic
prophecy here than the supposed direct and exclusive
reference did. By not grasping too desperately at the
view which more strikingly involves the supernatural, we
have received back with "full measure pressed down and
running over" the assurance that God was really speaking
here, and that this, like all the promises of the Old Testament
when rightly understood, is yea and amen in Christ.</p>

<p>But for our present purpose the primary reference of
this passage to the prophetic line is even more important
than the secondary but most vital reference to the
Messiah. For it sets forth prophecy as the most potent
instrument for the growth and furtherance of the religion of
Israel. The prophet is here declared to be the successor
of Moses, to be the inspired declarer of the Divine will to
His people in cases which did not come within the sphere
or the competency of the priest. The latter was, as we
have seen, bound to work within the limits and on the
basis of the revelation given by Moses. He was to carry
out into execution what had been commanded, to keep
alive in the hearts of the people the knowledge of their
God as Moses had given it, to give "Torah" from the
sanctuary in accordance with its principles. But here a
nobler office is assigned to the prophet. He is to enlarge
and develop the work of Moses. The Mosaic revelation
is here viewed as fundamental and normative, but, in
contrast to the views of later Judaism, as by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
complete. For the completion of it the prophet is here
declared to be the Divinely chosen instrument, and he
is consequently assigned a higher position in the purpose
of God than either king or priest. He is raised far above
the diviners by having his calling lifted into the moral
sphere; and he excels both the other organs of national
life in that, while they are largely bound by the past, he
is called of God to initiate new and higher stages in the
life of the chosen people. The ascending steps of the
revelation begun by Moses were to be in his hands, and
through him God was to reveal Himself in ever fuller
measure.</p>

<p>Viewed thus, the prophetic order in Israel has a quite
unique character. It is a provision for religious progress
such as had no parallel elsewhere in the world; and
this public acknowledgment of its Divine right is almost
more remarkable. Wherever elsewhere in the world
religion has been supposed to be Divinely given through
one man, though modifications have indeed been made in
later times, yet they have never been anticipated and provided
for beforehand. Save in the case of Mohammedanism,
which borrowed its idea of the office of the prophet from
Judaism, there has never been a deliberate admission that
God had yet higher things to reveal concerning Himself,
still less has provision been made for the coming of that
which was new to fulfil the old. And in modern times
the revealer of new aspects of truth finds nowhere a
welcome. Instead of being received as a messenger of
God, even in the Christian Church he has always to face
neglect, often persecution, and only if he be unusually
fortunate does he live to see his message received. But
in Israel, even in such ancient days as those we are
dealing with, the progressive nature of God's Revelation
of Himself was acknowledged, the reception of new truth
was legitimised and looked for, and the highest place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the earthly kingdom of God was reserved for those whom
God had enlightened by it. It is true of course that the
nation as a whole never acted in accordance with this
teaching. They did not obey the command given here,
"Unto him shall ye hearken," and reiterated still more
solemnly in the words, "And it shall come to pass, that
whosoever will not hearken unto My words, which he shall
speak in My name, I will require of him." The prophets
for the most part spoke to their contemporaries in vain.
Where they were not neglected they were persecuted, and
many sealed their testimony with their blood. But the
thought that Yahweh was educating His people step by
step, and that at all times in their history He would have
further revelations of Himself to make, is familiar to this
writer. Therefore he welcomes the thought of advance in
this region of things, and here solemnly enrols those who
are to be the instruments of it among the ruling powers
of the nation.</p>

<p>Now in religious thought this is quite unparalleled.
Tenacious conservatism, based on the conviction that full
truth has already been attained, has always been the mark
of religious thinking. That a religious teacher should
be able to see that the light of revelation, like the natural
light, must come gradually, broadening by degrees into
perfect day, and that he himself was standing only in the
morning twilight, is a thing so remarkable that one is at a
loss to account for it, save on the ground of the special
nature of prophetic enlightenment. It was part of the office
of the prophets to foresee and foretell the future. Smend
is certainly in the right, as against those who have been
teaching that the prophet was merely a preacher of genius,
when he says that "in Amos and his successors prophecy
is the starting-point of their whole discourse and action,"
and that "all new knowledge which they preach comes to
them from the action of Yahweh which they foretell....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Consequently the greatness of a prophet is to be gathered
from the measure in which he foresees the future."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
This statement gives us the truth that lies between the
two other extremes; for according to it the prophet proclaims
and preaches religious truth, but he does so on
the basis of what he perceives that God is about to do
in the future. In other words, he proclaims new truth
on the ground of the revelation God is about to make of
Himself, which he is inspired to foresee and to interpret.
His business is neither all foreseeing nor all teaching;
it is teaching grounded upon foresight. Consequently it
was impossible for the prophet to believe that change
in religion was in itself evil. He <em>knew</em> to the contrary.
Only change which should remove men from the Divinely
given basis of the faith was evil; and such change,
whatever credentials might accompany it, even though
they might be miraculous, every faithful Israelite had
been already warned most sternly to reject (Deut. xiii. 5).
But when the impulse to advance came from Yahweh's
manifestation of Himself, change was not only good, it
was the indispensable test of faithfulness. They were
not the true followers of Isaiah who, on the ground of
his prophecy that Zion, as Yahweh's dwelling-place,
should be delivered from destruction, rejected the prophecy
of Jeremiah that Zion would fall before the Chaldeans.
The really faithful men were those who had taken to
heart the lessons Yahweh had set for His people in the
century that lay between these two prophets; who saw
that the time when the deliverance of Zion was necessary
to the safety of the true religion was past, and that now
the capture of Zion was necessary to its true development.
And that is not a solitary case; it is an example of what
was normal in the religious history of this people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>
<p>This did not escape the quick eye of John Stuart
Mill. He says the religion of Israel "gave existence
to an inestimably precious unorganised institution&mdash;the
order (if it may be so termed) of prophets....
Religion, consequently, was not there, what it has
been in so many other places, a consecration of all
that was once established, and a barrier against further
improvement." There always was the movement of
pulsing life within it, and under the Divine guidance that
movement was always upward. At some times it was
comparatively shallow and slow, at others it was a deep
and rushing tide. But it was always moving in directions
which led straight to the great consummation of itself in
the coming of Christ, who gathered up into His own life
all the varied streams of revelation, and crowned and
fulfilled them all. At no point in the progress from Moses
to the Messiah do we touch rounded and completed truth;
nor, according to the teaching of Scripture in this passage,
were we meant to do so. The faithful among Israel
had as their watchword the <i>disio</i> and <i>pace</i> of Dante.
They saw before them a world of Divine "peace," which
they knew lay still in the future, and the "desire" and
yearning of their souls were always directed towards it.
With inextinguishable hope they marched onward with
uplifted faces, to which light reflected from that future
gave at times a radiant gladness; and always they kept an
open ear for those who saw what God was about to do at
each turning of the way.</p>

<p>But granting that religion was thus progressive before
men were spoken unto "by the Son," can we say or
believe that, now that He has spoken, progress in this
way is still possible? At first sight it would seem
necessary to answer that question in the negative. The
progressive revelation of God has come to its perfection
in Jesus Christ; what then remains to us but to cling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
that? Are we not bound to make resistance to progress,
to any new view in religion, our first duty? Many act
and speak as if that were the only possible course consistent
with faithfulness. But we must distinguish. The
revelation of God has, according to our Christian faith,
reached not only its highest actual point, but also its
highest possible point in Christ. God can do nothing more
for His vineyard than He has done. As a manifestation
of God, revelation is completed and closed in Christ. For
it is impossible to manifest God to men more fully than
in a man who reveals God in every thought and word
and act.</p>

<p>But it is quite otherwise with the interpretation of the
manifestation. In the earlier days this was provided for
by a special inspiration of God, which made the holy men
of old infallible in their interpretation of the revelation
received up to their day, and that continued till the
establishment of the Church. Since then the Holy Spirit
is to be the guide of faithful men into all truth. Now in
the way of interpreting Christ and His message progress
is as much open to us as it was to Israel. A complete
revelation of God must necessarily, at any given time up
till the consummation of all things, contain in it a residuum
of significance which, at that point of their experience,
mankind has not felt the need of, nor has had the
capacity to understand. As the world grows older,
however, new outlooks, new environments, new circumstances
continually appear, and they all insist upon being
dealt with by the Church. In order to deal with them
adequately and worthily, a faithful Church must turn
to Christ to see what God would have it do; and if
Christ be what we take Him to be, there will issue from
Him a light, unseen or unnoticed before, to meet the
hitherto unfelt need. Moreover, while our Lord Jesus
Christ reveals God completely as the God of Redemption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and throws light upon all God's relations to man, a light
which needs and admits of no supplementary addition,
there are other aspects of the Divine character which He
does not so entirely reveal. For example, God's relations
to the world of nature, which are now being unveiled in a
most striking manner, are dealt with comparatively rarely
in the Gospels. Are we to shut our eyes to these as of
no importance, and to allow them no influence upon our
thoughts? Surely that cannot be demanded of us; for,
to speak plainly, it is impossible. No one can remain
unmoved when God and man are revealing themselves in
the wondrous panorama of the world's life.</p>

<p>Even those who most profess to do so in no case take
their stand simply and solely upon the truths believed and
held by the first Christians. All of them have adopted
later developments as part of their indefeasible treasure.
Some go back to the theology of the great Evangelical
Revival only; some to the Reformation; some to the pre-Reformation
Scholastics; others to the first five centuries.
But whatever the point may be at which they take up
Christian theology, they take up, along with the original
creed of the first believers, some truths or doctrines which
emerged and were accepted at a later date. Themselves
being judges, therefore, additions to the primitive deposit
of faith have to be admitted; and it is a purely arbitrary
proceeding on their part to say that now we have attained
to all truth, and stolid conservatism is henceforth the only
faithful attitude. No, we have still a living God and a
living Church, and a multifarious and wonderful world to
deal with. Interaction of these cannot be avoided, nor
can it occur without new truth being evolved. To have
ears and not to hear, to have eyes and not to see, must be
as offensive to God now as it was in Old Testament times.
Though we have now no inspired prophets to foresee
and interpret, we have in all our Churches men whose ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
are better attuned to the celestial harmony than others,
whose eyes have a keener and surer insight into what God
the Lord would speak; and we ought to hear them, to see
at least whether they can make their position good. To
reject their teaching, only because some element or aspect
of it is new, is to deny the guiding providence of God, to
turn our back upon the rich stores of instruction which the
facts of history, both secular and religious, are fitted to
impart. That can never be a Christian duty. Even if it
were possible it would be futile. The light will be received
by the younger, the fresher and less stereotyped natures
in all the Churches; and those who refuse it, in holding
obstinately and with exclusive devotion to what they
have, will find it shrink and shrivel in their hand. Only
in the rush and conflict, only amid the impulses and the
powers which are moving in the world, can a healthy
religion breathe. Doubtless new teaching will come to <em>us</em>
in ways congruous to the completed Revelation of our
Redeeming God; but it will come; and it should be
welcomed as gladly as the teaching of the prophets was
welcomed by faithful men in Israel. If it be not, then
the Divine threat will apply in this case as fully as in
the other: "Whosoever will not hearken unto My words
which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him."</p>

<p>Many say now, and at all times many have said, to
those who had caught glimpses of some new lesson God
was desiring to teach: "You admit that souls have been
renewed and character built up and spiritual life preserved
without this new teaching. Why then can you not let us
alone? In your pursuit of the best you may destroy the
good; and no harm can happen if you keep the improved
faith to yourself." But they have forgotten Yahweh's
solemn "Whosoever will not hearken, I will require it of
him." If we refuse to hear when the Lord hath spoken,
evil must come of it. Indeed, though the evils of heresy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
may be more dramatically and strikingly manifest, those
of stagnation and a refusal to learn may be much more
destructive of the common faith. For refusal to acknowledge
truth has far wider issues than the loss of any
particular truth. It indicates and reinforces an attitude
of soul which, if persisted in, will allow the Church that
adopts it to drift slowly away from living contact with the
minds of men. So drifting, it shrinks into a <em>coterie</em>, and its
every activity becomes infected with the curse of futility.</p>

<p>On both sides, therefore, there is danger for us, as there
was for the Old Testament Church; and we turn with
quickened interest to the test, the criterion, by which
Deuteronomy would have the prophets tried. It puts the
very question which the line of thought we have been
pursuing could not fail to suggest: "How shall we know
the word which Yahweh hath not spoken?" If a prophet
spoke in the name of other gods he was to die; that had
already been determined in the thirteenth chapter, and it
is repeated here. But the prophet who should speak a
word presumptuously in the name of Yahweh, which He
had not commanded, was to be in the same condemnation.
It was, therefore, of the last importance that there should
be means of detecting when this last evil occurred. The
test is this: "When a prophet speaketh in the name of
Yahweh, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is
the thing which Yahweh hath not spoken." The strange
notions of Duhm and others in regard to this have been
already dealt with (<i>vide</i> pp. 248 f.). There, too, it has been
shown that the prophecy here spoken of must have been
prophecy in its narrower sense, prophecy dealing with
promises of <em>immediate</em> judgment and deliverance. Furthermore,
this is set forth here as a test applicable to prophets
in all ages of the history of Israel. It lies, too, in the
nature of the case that it must always have been the
popular test. The announcement of things to come before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
they came was made, at least partially, with the view of
impressing the populace, and of gaining their confidence
and attention. They must consequently have been continually
on the alert to apply this test, and all that is here
done is to acknowledge it in the fullest manner as a right
and Divinely approved criterion.</p>

<p>But the way in which it ought to be applied is best
exemplified by Jeremiah's own method of applying it,
which, as Dr. Edersheim<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> has pointed out, is to be found
in the twenty-eighth chapter of that prophet's book. There
we read of Jeremiah's conflict with "Hananiah the son of
Azzur the prophet," in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah. Just previously Nebuchadnezzar had carried
away Jeconiah the king of Judah, with all the treasures
of the house of Yahweh and the strength of the people.
Jeremiah had prophesied that they would not return; nay,
he had foretold a further calamity, viz. that Nebuchadnezzar
would come again and would take away the people
and the vessels of the house which still remained. In
opposition to that, Hananiah declared, as a word of
Yahweh, "Within two full years will I bring again into
this place all the vessels of Yahweh's house that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this
place, and carried them to Babylon; and I will bring
again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of
Judah, with all the captives of Judah that went to Babylon,
saith Yahweh." Jeremiah's conduct under these circumstances
is noteworthy. He did not immediately denounce
his rival as prophesying falsely. He seems to have thought
that possibly he might have a true word from Yahweh,
since, as we see in the Book of Jonah, the most positive
prophecies were conditional, and Jeremiah would seem
to have thought it possible that personal repentance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
about to bring upon the captive king and people a blessing,
instead of the evil he had foreseen. He consequently
expressed a fervent wish that Hananiah's prophecy might
come true, but reminded his rival that the causes of the
evil prophecies of himself and previous prophets were far
wider than the ground which the personal repentance of
the captives could cover. Because of that he evidently
felt the gravest doubt about Hananiah; but he disposes of
the matter by saying, "The prophet which prophesieth of
peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass,
then shall the prophet be known, that Yahweh hath truly
sent him." Only afterwards, when he had himself
received a special revelation concerning Hananiah, did he
denounce him as an impostor and a false prophet.</p>

<p>The whole narrative is of extreme importance, for it
shows us how the prophets themselves regarded their own
supernatural powers, and how they used the tests supplied
in Deuteronomy. In the first place, they asked how the new
word of Yahweh stood in regard to the older words which
He had certainly spoken. If there was any possible way
in which the new and the old could be reconciled, they
gave the new the benefit of the doubt, and left the
decision to the event. Obviously had there been no way
of reconciling Hananiah's prophecy with the mass of
contrary prophecy which had gone before, Jeremiah would
have denounced him under the law of Deut. xiii. 5 as
leading away from Yahweh. As it was, he fell back
upon the test in this twenty-eighth chapter, and would
have maintained an attitude of watchful neutrality until
the event had justified or condemned his rival, had not
Yahweh Himself settled the question.</p>

<p>For our own day and in our different circumstances
the tests are radically the same, though, as prophecy is
extinct in the Church, they must to some extent act
differently. The New Testament parallel to the criterion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
in Deut. xiii. 5 is to be found in 1 John iv. 1, 2, and 3:
"Prove the spirits, whether they are of God: because
many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby
know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesseth
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: and
every spirit which confesseth not Jesus is not of God:
and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have
heard that it cometh." Under the Christian dispensation
to deny "that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh" is the
same as it was to say under the earlier dispensation "Let
us go after other gods," so completely do God and Christ
coincide in our most holy faith. In each case the
ultimate test of prophecy is to be the fundamental principle
of the faith. Whatever credentials teachers who
deny that may bring, they are to be unhesitatingly
rejected. They belong to the world, that scheme and
fabric of things which rejects allegiance to the Spirit of
God. Least of all is popularity with the world as distinguished
from the Church, or with the worldly portion
of the Church, to stand in the way of its rejection. That
is only the natural consequence of its being "of the
world." Within the Church no quarter is to be shown
to such teaching, for it really carries with it the absolute
negation of the faith.</p>

<p>But what of erroneous teaching which acknowledges
that "Jesus Christ is come in the flesh"? To it the Old
Testament parallel is the utterance of the prophet who
"speaketh in the name of Yahweh, and the thing followeth
not nor comes to pass." According to Old Testament
precept and example, that was to be left to the judgment
of time. In our day a corresponding course must be
found. The case supposed is that of teaching believed
to be erroneous, but neither fundamentally subversive of
Christianity nor destructive of the special principles of a
Church. If so, earnest opposition by those who hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
opposite view, and adequate discussion, are the true way of
meeting the case. For the rest, the final decision should
be left to experience. In time, even subsidiary error of
this kind, if important, will manifest itself by weakening
spiritual life in those who hold it; they will gradually
dwindle in numbers and their influence in the Church will
die away. They begin by promising renewed strength and
insight in spiritual things, renewed energy in the spiritual
life. If that "follow not nor come to pass," when due
time has been given for any such development, then that
is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, and it
should be dealt with as the fundamental heresy is to be
dealt with. But probably by that time it will have judged
itself, and will need no judgment of men at all.</p>

<p>These then were the connecting links between Yahweh
and His people, and the organs by which the life of the
Israelite nation was guided: the Kingship, the Priesthood,
and the Prophetic Order. The first gave visibility to the
Divine rule, and stability to national and social life; the
second secured the stability of religion, and built up
the moral life of the nation on the basis of Mosaic law;
the third secured progress and averted stagnation, both in
religion and in social and individual morals. In fact,
order and progress, the two things Positivist thinkers have
set forth as those which can alone secure health to a community,
are provided for here with a directness and success
which it would be difficult to parallel elsewhere. When
we remember how small, how obscure, and how uncivilised
the people was to whom this scheme of things was given,
and how little their surroundings or circumstances were
calculated to suggest such far-reaching provisions, we see
that the source of it all was the Revelation of the Divine
character given by Moses. Yahweh as revealed through
him did not permit His worshippers to believe that they
could, at one moment, receive all that was to be known about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Him. They were taught to found their conduct and their
polity upon what they did know, and to be eagerly on the
watch for that which might be revealed at new crises of their
history. Now that teaching finds its most complete expression
in the laws concerning the three institutions we have
been reviewing. Behind all healthy national life and all
stable institutions there was, so had this people learned,
the power and the righteousness of Almighty God. In
His eagerness to draw near to men, He had changed the
priest, the king, the prophet from being, as they were
among the heathen, merely political and religious officials
appointed for purely earthly ends, into channels of communication
with Him. Through them there were poured
into the life of this nation wholesome and varied streams
of Divine grace and enlightenment, and a just balance
between conservatism and reform in religion was admirably
secured. Consequently, amid all drawbacks, the Israelites
became an instrument of the finest power for good in the
hands of their Almighty King; and even when their outward
glory faded, they were inwardly renewed and pressed
onward age after age. "Without hasting and without
resting," the purpose of God was realised in their history,
guided by these three organs of their national life. Each
contributed its share in preparing for the fulness of the
time when He came who was the Salvation of God, and
each supplied elements of the most essential kind to the
mingled expectation which was so marvellously satisfied
by the life and work of Christ. They wrought together
in the fullest harmony, moreover, though they were not
always conscious of doing so. For they all moved at
the bidding of the still small voice wherewith God
speaks most effectively to the souls of men. Because
of this their purposes took a wider sweep than they
knew, their hopes received wings which carried them far
away beyond the horizon of Old Testament time; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
starting from the remotest points, all the streams of
the national life converged, till, at the close of the Old
Testament time, they were running in such directions that
they could not fail in little space to meet. It was therefore
no surprise to the faithful in Israel when, at the
beginning of the New Testament, they were found to have
met in Jesus the Christ. Once that point was reached,
the whole former history, which was now lying completed
before the eyes of all, could be fully appreciated. Everything
in the past seemed to speak of Him. If, in that first
burst of joyous surprise, Messianic references of the most
definite kind were found where we now can see only faint
hints and adumbrations, we need not wonder. So much
more had been spoken of Him than they had thought,
it would have been strange had they not swung a little
to the opposite extreme. But that need not hinder us
from acknowledging that the history of Israel, viewed from
their standpoint, was and is the most conspicuous, the
most convincing, the most inspiring proof of the Divine
action in the world. The finger of God was so manifestly
<em>here</em>, harmonising, directing, impelling, that the evidence
for Divine guidance in much more obscure regions
becomes irresistible. With this history before us we can
believe that it was not only in those far-off days, and
in that little corner of Asia that God was active for the
production of good. Now and here, as well as then and
there, there are Divine and guiding forces at work in the
world; and the only safe politics, the only truly prosperous
peoples, are those in which rulers and priests and prophets
are secured, to whom the secret of God is open.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3><i>THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF ISRAELITE LIFE</i></h3>


<p>It has often and justly been said that the life of Israel
is so entirely founded on the grace and favour of God
that no distinction is made between the secular and the
religious laws. Whatever their origin may have been,
whether they had been part of the tribal constitution
before Moses' day or not, they were all regarded as
Divinely given. They had been accepted as fit building
stones for the great edifice of that national life in which
God was to reveal Himself to all mankind, and behind
them all was the same Divine authority. That being so,
it is not wonderful, in times like these, when the air is
full of plans and theories for the reconstruction of society
in the interest of the toiling masses of men, that believers
in the Scriptures should turn with hope to the legislation
of the Old Testament. In the present state of things the
material conditions of life are far more deadening and
demoralising for the multitude in civilised countries than
they are in many uncivilised lands. That this should be so
is intolerable to all who think and feel; and men turn with
hope to a scene where God is teaching and training men,
not merely in regard to their individual life, as in the New
Testament, but also in regard to national life. It is seen,
too, that the tone and feeling of these laws are sympathetic
for the poor as no other code has ever been; and many
maintain that, if we would only return to the provisions
of these laws, the social crisis which is as yet only in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
beginning, and which threatens to darken and overshadow
all lands, would be at once and wholly averted. Men
consequently are diligently inquiring what the land tenure
of ancient Israel was, what its trade laws were, how the
poor were dealt with, and how and to what extent
pauperism was averted or provided for. Many say, If
God has spoken in and by this people, so that their first
steps in religion and morals have been the starting-point
for the highest life of humanity, may we not
expect that their first steps in political and social life
will have the same abiding value, if rightly understood?
Now the main thing in regard to which the economical
arrangements of a nation are important is land. In
modern times there may be some exceptionally situated
communities, such as the British people, among whom
commerce and manufactures are more important than
agriculture; but in ancient times no such case could arise.
In every community the land and the land tenure were
the fundamentally important things.</p>

<p>Now the fundamental thing concerning it was that
Yahweh, being the King of Israel, who had formed and
was guiding this people as His instrument for saving the
world, and who had bestowed their country upon them,
was regarded as the sole owner of the soil. It is not
necessary to quote texts to prove this, since it is the
fundamental assumption throughout the Old Testament
Scriptures that the Israelite title to their land was the
gift of Yahweh. He had promised it to the fathers. He
had driven out the Canaanite nations before Israel. He
had by His mighty hand and His stretched-out arm
established His chosen people in the place which He had
chosen, and He had granted them the use and enjoyment
of it so long as they proved faithful to Him. Consequently,
in a quite real and palpable sense, there was no owner of
land in Israel save Yahweh. And this thought was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
without practical consequences of great moment. It was
not a mere religious sentiment, it was a hard and palpable
fact, that Yahweh ruled. Absolute proprietorship could
never be built up on that basis, and never as a matter of
fact, was acknowledged in Israel. All were tenants, who
held their places only so long as they obeyed the statutes
of Yahweh. The sale in perpetuity of that which had been
portioned out to tribes and families was consequently entirely
prohibited. As against other nations, indeed, Israel was
to possess this land, so that no heathen could be permitted
to buy and possess even a scrap of it; but as against
Yahweh and the purposes for which He had chosen Israel,
all were equally strangers and sojourners, practically
tenants at will, who could neither give nor take their
holdings as if they were absolutely theirs. Yet, relatively,
the land was given to the community as a whole, and
according to Joshua xiii. 7 sqq. (a passage generally
assigned to the Deuteronomic editor) it was parcelled out
by lot to the various tribes just before Joshua's death,
according to their respective numbers.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Then within the
tribal domain the families in the wider sense had their
portion, and within these family domains again the
individual households. In this way the Israelite tenure of
land occupies a middle point between the theories of
Socialism, and the high doctrine of private property in
land which declares that the individual owner can do
what he will with his own. The nation as a whole
claimed rights over all the land, but it did not attempt to
manage the public estate for the common good. It delegated
its powers to the tribes. But not even they
undertook the burdens of proprietorship. Under them
the families undertook a general superintendence; but the
true proprietary rights, the cultivation of the soil, and the
drawing of profit from it, subject only to deductions made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
by the larger bodies, the families, the tribes, and the
nation, were exercised only by individuals. The nation
took care that none of its territory should be sold to
foreigners, lest the national inheritance should be diminished,
and the tribes did the same for the tribal heritage,
as we see from the narrative concerning the daughters of
Zelophehad. It was only within limits therefore, that
the individual proprietor was free; and though the rights
of property were respected, the corresponding duties of
property were set forth with irresistible clearness. The
community, in fact, never abandoned its claims upon the
common heritage, any more than Israel's Divine King did,
and consequently the field within which proprietary rights
were exercised was more restricted here than in any
modern state.</p>

<p>Further, besides the prohibition of absolute sale which
flowed from the recognition of Yahweh's ownership, and
the limitations which tribal and family claims involved,
there were distinct provisions in which the national ownership
under Yahweh was plainly asserted. For example,
it is enacted in Deut. xxiii. 24&mdash;"When thou comest into
thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes
thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put
any in thy vessel. When thou comest into thy neighbour's
standing corn, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine
hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's
standing corn." Allied to these were the provisions
(Lev. xix. 9 ff., xxiii. 10) concerning gleaning,
and not reaping the corners of the field. It will be
observed that, though these latter may be discounted as
intended for the relief of the poor alone, the former
provision was for all, and that consequently it may be
regarded as an undoubted assertion of the common ownership,
or common <i>usufruct</i>, which, though latent, was always
held to be a fact. In other ways also the same hint is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
given. The provisions for letting the land lie fallow in
the seventh year and in the jubilee year, and for securing
the use of what grew in the field for all who chose to take
it, were interferences with the free-will of the individual
owners or occupiers, which find their justification only in
the fact that the general ownership was never suffered
entirely to fall into the background.</p>

<p>To sum up then this system aimed at securing the advantages
both of the socialist view and of the individualistic
view, while avoiding the evils of both. Private enterprise
was encouraged, by the individual being guaranteed
possession of his land against any other individual;
while public spirit and a regard for general interests
were promoted by the restrictions which limited the
private ownership. Further, and more important still,
the whole relation of the nation and of the individual to
the land was raised out of the merely sordid region of
material gain into the spiritual and moral region, by the
principle that Yahweh their God alone had full proprietary
rights over the soil. All were "sojourners" with Him.
He had promised this land to their fathers as the place
wherein He should specially reveal Himself to them.
Here, communion with Him was to be established, and
to each household there had been assigned by Yahweh a
special portion of it, which it would be equally a sin and
an unspeakable loss to part with. Compulsion alone could
justify such a surrender; and the completed legislation,
whatever its date, and even if it remained always an unrealised
ideal, shows how determined the effort was to
secure the perpetuity of the tenure in the original hands.
The ideal of Israelite life was consequently that the land
should remain in the hands of the hereditary owners, and
that the main support of all the people should be agricultural
labour.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>
<p>The hypothesis that this was the case is strengthened
to a certainty by the manner in which commerce, one of
the other main sources of wealth, is dealt with in the
Israelite law. There is but little sympathy expressed
with it, and some of the regulations issued are such as
to render trade on any very large scale within Palestine
itself impossible. From the use of the word "Canaanite" in
the Old Testament (cf. Job xli. 6; Prov. xxxi. 24; Zeph.
i. 11; Ezek. xvii. 4, and Isa. xxiii. 8) it is clear that,
even in the later periods of Israelite history, the merchants
were so prevailingly Canaanites that the two words are
synonymous. Nay, more; there can be no doubt that the
commercial career was looked down upon. Even as early
as the prophet Hosea the Canaanite name is connected
with false weights and vulgar commercial cheating (Hos.
xii. 7), and it is looked upon as a last degradation that
Ephraim should take delight in similar pursuits. In all
that we read of merchants in the Old Testament we seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
to hear the expression of a feeling that commerce, with
its necessary wanderings, its temptations to dishonesty,
its constant contact with heathen peoples, was an occupation
that was unworthy of a son of Israel. Even Solomon's
success as a royal merchant would not seem to have overcome
this feeling, nor did the later commercial successes
of kings like Jehoshaphat. In fact the ordinary Israelite
had the home-staying farmer's contempt and suspicion of
these far-wandering commercial people, so much more
nimble-witted than himself, who were therefore to be
regarded with half-admiring wariness.</p>

<p>But the very sinews of extensive commerce were cut by
the law against the taking of interest from a brother
Israelite.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Without credit, or the lending of money,
or what is called sleeping partnership (and all these are
bound up with receiving interest), it is impossible to have
extensive trade. Without them every merchant would
have to limit his operations to cash transactions and to
his own immediate capital, and the great combinations
which especially bring wealth would be impossible. Now
we do not need at present to discuss the wisdom of prohibiting
the taking of interest, nor the still more debated
question whether that ancient prohibition would be wise
or advantageous now. It is enough for our purpose that
usury in its literal sense was actually forbidden among
Israelites, and that they were thus shut out from the
developed commercial life of the surrounding nations.
As a result trade remained in a merely embryonic
condition.</p>

<p>But in still other ways the Sinaitic legislation interfered
with its development. The inculcation of ceremonial
purity, especially in food, and the effort to make Israel a
peculiar people unto Yahweh, which distinguishes even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the earlier forms of the law, made intercourse with
foreigners and living abroad, always difficult, and under
some circumstances impossible. Consequently all the
legislation that can possibly be considered commercial
was of a very rudimentary character. From every point
of view it is clear that ancient Israel was not a commercial
people, and that the Divine law was intended
to restrain them from commercial pursuits. They could
not have been the holy and peculiar people they were
meant to be, had they become a nation of traffickers.</p>

<p>With regard to manufacturing industries the case was not
essentially different. Such pursuits were, it is true, more
honoured than commerce was, for skill in all arts, whether
agricultural or industrial, was regarded as a special gift
of the Almighty. But so far as the records go, there is
no evidence that a manufacturing industry existed, beyond
what the very limited needs of the nation itself demanded.
From the fact that, according to Prov. xxxi. 24, which
was probably written late in the history of Israel, the
manufacturing of linen garments for sale and of girdles
for the Canaanites was the business of the thrifty and
virtuous housewife, we may gather that systematic wholesale
manufacture of such things was unknown. Probably
the case was not otherwise in regard to all branches of
industry. There are no traces of trade castes, nor of
manufacturing towns; so that the manufacturing industries,
so far as they existed, had no other place than that
of handmaids to agriculture, by which the nation really
lived.</p>

<p>According to the Old Testament, then, the ideal state
of things for a people like Israel was that every household
should be settled upon the land, that permanent eviction
from or even alienation of the holdings should be impossible,
and that the whole population should have a
common interest in agriculture, that most honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
and fundamental of all human pursuits. There were,
of course, some men in Israel more prominent than
others, and some richer, but there was to be no impassable
barrier between classes such as we find in Eastern
countries where caste prevails, or in Western countries
where the aristocratic principle has drawn a deep dividing
line between those of "good" blood and all others. So
far as is known, there were no class barriers to intermarriage.
From the highest to the lowest, all were servants
of Yahweh, and were consequently equal. The conditions
of the land tenure were such that it was impossible, if they
were respected, that large estates should accumulate in the
hands of individuals, and a landless proletariate could not
arise. The very rich and the very poor were alike legislated
out of existence, and a sufficient provision for all was
that which was aimed at. By the cycle of Sabbatic periods
(the weekly Sabbath, the Sabbatic year, and the year
of jubilee) ample rest for the land and its inhabitants
was secured; and in the limits set upon the period for
which a Hebrew slave might be retained, in the release,
whatever that was, which the seventh year brought to the
debtor, and in the restoration of land to the impoverished
owner in the year of jubilee, such a series of breakwaters
were erected against the inrushing flood of pauperism,
that, had they been maintained, the world would have
seen for the first time a fairly civilised community in
which even moderate ill-desert in a man could not bring
irretrievable ruin upon his posterity. The prodigal was
hindered from selling his heritage; he could only sell the
use of it for a number of years. He could not ruin
himself by borrowing at extravagant rates of interest,
for no one was tempted to lend him, and usury was
forbidden. He might indeed run into debt and be sold
into slavery along with his family, but that could only
be for a few years, and then they all resumed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
former position. In this very land where the fact,
Divinely impressed upon human life, that the sins of
the fathers were visited on the children was most
unflinchingly taught, the most elaborate precautions were
taken to mitigate the severity of this necessary law.
From the first the ideal was that there should be no
son or daughter of Israel oppressed or impoverished
permanently; and whatever the stages of advance in
Israelite law may have been, and whatever the date
of particular ordinances may be, there is an admirable
consistency of aim throughout. Even should it be proved
that the Sabbatic ordinances remained mere generous
aspirations, which never entered into the practical life
of the people at all, that fact would only emphasise
the earnestness and persistency with which the inspired
legislators pursued their generous aim. No change in
circumstances turned them aside. The glitter of the
wealth acquired by Solomon and other kings by commerce
never seduced them. No ideal but that early
one of every man sitting under his own vine and his
own fig-tree, with none to make him afraid, which is
witnessed to before the Exile (Micah iv. 4), in the Exile
(1 Kings iv. 25), and after the Exile (Zech. iii. 10),
was ever cherished by them; and the whole economic
legislation is entirely consistent with what we know of
the earliest time. And the deepest roots of it all were
religious. The Biblical writers have no doubt at all
that the ideal economic state can be reached only by a
people attuned by religion to self-sacrifice, to pity, and to
justice. In this they differ radically from the socialists
or semi-socialists of to-day. These imagine that man
needs only a favourable environment to become good;
whereas the Scriptural writers know that to use well
the best environment is a task which, more than anything,
puts strain upon the moral and spiritual nature. For to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
deal in a supremely wise fashion with great opportunities
is the part only of a nature perfectly moralised. Consequently
all the social laws of Israel are made to have
their root in the relation of the people to their God.</p>

<p>There was only one power that could secure that this
admirable machinery would move, and keep it moving.
That was the love and fear of God. The conduct
prescribed was the conduct befitting the <em>true</em> Israelite, the
man who was faithful in all his ways. The laws marked
out the paths wherein he should walk if he willed to do
God's will. They were, therefore, ideal in all their
highest prescriptions, and could never become real except
where the true religion had had its perfect work. In that
respect the Sermon on the Mount resembles the Israelite
law. It presupposes a completely Christian society,
just as the old law presupposes a completely Yahwistic
society, <i>i.e.</i> a society made up of men who made devotion
to their God the chief motive of their lives. In such a
community there would have been no difficulty in entirely
realising the state of things aimed at here, just as in a
community penetrated by the love of Christ the Sermon
on the Mount would be not only practicable but natural.
But without that supreme motive much that the enactments
of both the Old Testament and the New demand
must remain mere aspiration. Just in proportion as
Israel was true to Yahweh was the law realised, and
the demands of the law always acted as a spur to the
better part of the people to enter into fuller sympathy
and communion with Him in order that they might
respond to them. The law and the religion of the people
acted and reacted upon one another, but the greater of
these two elements was religion.</p>

<p>It was not wonderful, therefore, that to a large extent
this legislation failed, as men measure failure. The religious
state of the nation never was what it should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
been; and the law, though it was held to be Divine, was
never wholly observed. In the Northern Kingdom, by the
time of the Syrian wars, the old constitution of Israel
had broken up. The hardy yeomanry had been ruined
and dispersed. Their lands had been seized or bought
by the rich, and every law that had been made to ensure
restoration was habitually disregarded. As Robertson
Smith states it,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>: "The unhappy Syrian wars sapped
the strength of the country, and gradually destroyed the
old peasant proprietors who were the best hope of the
nation. The gap between the many poor and the few
rich became wider and wider. The landless classes were
ground down by usury and oppression, for in that state
of society the landless man had no career in trade, and
was at the mercy of the landholding capitalist." And in
Judah the state of things, though not so bad, was similar.
In the days of Zedekiah we know that Hebrew slaves
were held for life, instead of being released in the seventh
year.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The properties of those compelled to sell were
never returned to the owners, and all the laws that were
meant to secure the welfare and prosperity of the masses
of Israel were contemptuously disregarded. In short,
the worst features of a purely competitive civilisation,
with materialism eating into its soul, became glaringly
manifest. All the canonical prophets without exception
denounce the vices and tyrannies of the rich.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> As far as
can be learned, moreover, the year of release and the
Sabbatic year were not regularly or generally observed,
while the jubilee year would seem never to have been
kept after the Exile. The laws regarding taking interest
were also evaded.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless it would be a great error to suppose that
these Divinely given social laws should be branded as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
failure. They were not lived up to, and it is not improbable
that the corruption of the people's life was in a
degree intensified by the reaction from so high an ideal.
But the axiom which is current now in all the newspapers,
that laws too far above the general level of the national
conscience cannot be enforced, and becoming a dead letter
tend to produce lawlessness, does not apply to such
codes as those of Israel. These, as has more than once
been pointed out, were not of the same character as our
legal codes are. Among us, laws are meant to be observed
with minute and careful diligence, and any breach of them
is punished by the courts, which, on the whole, can be
easily set in motion. Ancient religious codes are never
of that kind. They do contain laws of that character, but
the bulk of the provisions are not laws which the executive
is to enforce, but ideals of conduct which the true
worshipper of God ought to strive to attain to. It is,
therefore, of their very essence that they should be far
above the average national conscience. Nations whose
ideals soar no higher than the possible attainment of
the average man as he is, have virtually no ideals at
all, and are cut off from all enduring upward impulses.
Those, on the contrary, who have a vision of the perfect
life, are certain to be both humbler, and at the same time
more sure to persist in the painful path of moral discipline.
As "a man's reach should exceed his grasp," so also
should a nation's; and though it is almost always forgotten,
it is precisely Israel's glory that she set up for
herself and exhibited to the world an ideal of brotherhood,
of love to God and man, to which she could not attain.
Great as the practical failure in Israel was, therefore, no
fault can be found in the legislation. It moulded the
characters of men who were sensitive to the influences
coming from God, so that they became fit instruments of
inspiration; and it made their lives examples of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
virtue that the ancient world knew. Further, it gave
shape to the hopes and aspirations of the people, especially
where it was not realised. The year of jubilee, for
example, is the groundwork of that great and affecting
promise contained in Isa. lxi: "The Spirit of the Lord
Yahweh is upon me, because Yahweh hath anointed me
to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent me
to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty (<i>deror</i>)
to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them
that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of
Yahweh and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort
all that mourn." That which was unattainable here,
amid the greeds and lusts of an unspiritual generation,
gave colour to the Messianic future; and men were taught
to look and wait for a kingdom of God in which a peace
and truth that could not as yet be reached would be the
certain possession of all.</p>

<p>When we turn to modern times and modern circumstances,
it is not easy to see how this ancient law can
be applicable to them. In the first place, much of it
was made binding upon Israel only because of its peculiar
character as the people to whom the true religion was
revealed. As custodians of that, they were justified in
keeping up walls of partition between themselves and
the world, which if universally accepted would only be
hurtful to the highest interests of mankind. On the contrary,
the development of the true religion having been
completed by the coming of Christ, it is the duty of those
nations which enjoy the light to spread abroad the "good
news" of God which they have received, and to exhibit its
power among all the nations of the earth. The highest
and most Divine call which can now come to any people
must, therefore, be radically different in some chief aspects
from that of Israel. In the second place, the civilisation
and culture of the great nations of to-day are far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
complicated than any ancient civilisation ever was, and
the general level is fixed by an action and reaction
extending over the whole civilised world. No successes
can be achieved, no blunders can be committed, in any
part of the world which do not affect almost immediately
the farthest ends of the earth. Moreover the intimate
and universal correlation of interest makes interference
with any part of the complicated whole an exceedingly
perilous matter. Any proposal that this law, as being
Divinely given, ought in its economic aspect to be made
universally binding, should therefore be met by a demand
for a careful inquiry into possible differences between
ancient life and modern, which might make guidance
Divinely given to the one inapplicable to the other. It
is not necessarily true that because Israel by Divine
command established every household upon the soil,
forbade interest, and did nothing to encourage trade and
manufactures, we should do these things. Take, for
instance, the case of interest. In our day, and in civilisations
of a high type, lending money to a person not in
distress at all, but who sees an opportunity of making-enough
by the use of borrowed money to pay the interest
and make a profit, is often a most praiseworthy and
charitable act.</p>

<p>But if the Israelite legislation in regard to interest
cannot justly be taken as a law for all time, still less can
any great modern state neglect or discourage commerce
and manufactures. The merely embryonic character of
commercial legislation, and the contempt for the merchant
which did in ancient days exist, would be exceedingly out
of place now. There is no career more honourable than
that of the merchant of our day when he carries on his
business in a high-minded fashion, nor is there any member
of the community whose calling is more beneficent than
his. So long as he looks for gain to himself in ways which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
taken on the great scale, bring benefit both to producer
and consumer, his activity is purely beneficial. There is
absolutely no reason why commercial life should not be as
honest, as sound, as much in accord with the mind of God,
in itself, as any other manner of life. For in many ways
it has been a civilising agent of the highest power. Of
course, if the charges brought against merchants by Ruskin,
for example, who seizes upon and believes every story
which involves charges of fraud against modern commerce,
were true; if it were impossible, as he says it is, for an
honest man to prosper in trade, then we might have some
ground for condemning this branch of human activity. But
happily only a confirmed and incorrigible pessimist can
believe that. In our time some of the noblest men of
whom we have any knowledge have been merchants, and
among no class has so much princely generosity been exhibited.
If mercantile help had been withdrawn from the
poor, if the time, the money, the organising skill which merchants
have freely expended upon charities were suddenly
to fail them, the case against our modern civilisation would
be indefinitely stronger than it is. Moreover the immense
expansion of credit which is at once the glory and the
danger of modern commerce, is itself a proof that such
wholesale condemnation as we have spoken of is
unwarrantable. The bulk of commerce must, after all,
be fairly sound, otherwise it could not continue and
spread as it does. And, as against the evils which
affect it in common with all human activities, we must
put the fact that it brings the produce of all lands to
the door even of the poor, and by the constant contact
between nations which it causes it is influencing the
thought as well as the lives of men. Human brotherhood
is being furthered by it, slowly, it is true, but surely, and
the barriers which separate the nations are being sapped
by its influence. These are indispensable services for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
future progress of mankind, and make commerce now as
much the necessary handmaid of the highest life as it
would have been a hindrance to it in the case of the chosen
people, before they had assimilated the truths of which
they were to be the bearers to the world. That commerce,
and trade in general, need to be purified goes without
saying. That it may, of late years, have deteriorated, as
the general decay of faith and the pursuit of luxury have
weakened the sanctions of morality, is not improbable.
But in itself it is not only a legitimate human activity; it
is also an admirable instrument for bringing home to the
consciences of men the truth that they are all their
brothers' keepers. It presses home as nothing else could
do the great truth proclaimed by St. Paul in regard to
the Church, as true also of the world, that if one member
suffers all the body suffers with it. Every day through
this channel men are receiving lessons, which they cannot
choose but hear, to the effect that no permanent benefit
can come from the loss and suffering of men in any part
of the world; that peace and righteousness and good faith
are things which have supreme value even in the mercantile
sense; and that, conversely, the merchant's pursuit of
wealth, if carried on in accord with the fundamental truths
of morality, inevitably becomes a potent factor in that
advance to a worldwide knowledge of the Lord, which
gleamed before the eyes of prophets and seers as the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Far-off Divine event,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the whole creation moves."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But if we cannot make the Old Testament our law in
regard to commerce, we must ask whether the legislation
in regard to land has for us any binding force? Viewing
it with this question in our minds, I think we must be
struck by one fact, this namely, that the universal
possession of land which was provided for in Israel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
so anxiously maintained is the only provision known
against the growth of a wage-earning class largely, if not
entirely, at the mercy of the employer. In Greece and
Rome the population at first were all settled on their own
lands, and it was only when by money-lending the small
properties were bought up and turned into huge farms,
worked by farm-bailiffs and slaves, that misery began to
invade all parts of the social fabric. In medi√¶val and
feudal England, on the other hand, and indeed wherever
the feudal system existed, the cultivators, even when
they were serfs, had an inalienable right to the land.
They could not be evicted if they rendered certain
not very burdensome services to the lord. "As long as
these dues were satisfied, it is plain the tenant was secure
from dispossession," says Professor Thorold Rogers (<cite>Six
Centuries</cite>, etc., p. 44). But in time that system was broken
down; and ever since, until within the last half-century,
the course of things with the labouring classes in England
has been one long descent. So long as the people were
attached to the soil, and so long as all alike practised
agriculture, as in Palestine under the Mosaic law,
Englishmen lived in rough plenty, and were for the most
part content. The fifteenth century was the golden age
of medi√¶val agriculture; but a change for the worse
came in with the seventeenth, and it continued.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Two measures&mdash;the introduction of competitive rents
with its corollary, eviction, and the enclosure of the
common lands&mdash;worked gradually on until they have
entirely divorced the workman from the soil, and
Professor Cairnes<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> has told us clearly what that means.
"In a contest between vast bodies of people so circumstanced
and the owners of the soil the negotiation could
have but one issue, that of transferring to the owners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the soil the whole produce, <em>minus</em> what was sufficient to
maintain in the lowest state of existence the race of
cultivators. This is what has happened wherever the
owners of the soil, discarding all considerations but those
dictated by self-interest, have really availed themselves of
the full strength of their position. It is what has happened
under rapacious governments in Asia; it is what
has happened under rapacious landlords in Ireland; it is
what now happens under the bourgeois proprietors of
Flanders; it is, in short, the inevitable result which cannot
but happen in the great majority of all societies now
existing on earth where land is given up to be dealt with
on commercial principles unqualified by public opinion,
custom, or law." The result is that the labourers have
only their daily wages to depend upon. "They have no
means of productive home industry; they have not even
a home from which they cannot be ejected at any moment
on failure to pay the weekly rent; they have no land,
garden, or domestic animals, the produce of which might
support them till fresh work could be obtained."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> We
need not wonder that this question of the occupancy of
land as the only visible remedy for the hideous social
state of the most highly civilised nations of the world is
gradually becoming <em>the</em> question of our time. A great
reaction against the purely commercial theory of land
tenure has taken place. The land legislation in Ireland
has been based on the doctrines that the nation cannot
permit absolute property in land, and that there is no
hope for any permanent improvement in the condition of
the poor until labourers have land of their own. Now
these are precisely the principles of the Scriptural land
legislation. Under it landlords with absolute rights over
land were impossible, and the rise of a proletariate at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
mercy of the capitalist was also impossible. It is not so
strange, therefore, as it might at first sight appear that the
demands of advanced land reformers, as they are voiced
in Mr. Wallace's book (p. 192), are, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
identical with the provisions of the Israelite law. He
demands (1) that landlordism shall be superseded by
occupying ownership; (2) that the tenure of the holders
of land must be made secure and permanent; (3) that
arrangements must be made by which every British
subject may secure a portion of land for personal occupation
at its fair agricultural value; and (4) that in order that
these conditions be rendered permanent sub-letting must
be absolutely prohibited, and mortgages strictly limited.
This essential oneness of view in the modern land reformer
and in the ancient law is all the more remarkable
that, so far as can be gathered from his book, Mr. Wallace
has never regarded the Old Testament from this point
of view. He never quotes it, and is apparently quite
unconscious that the plan which experience of present
evils, and acute and disinterested reflection on them, has
suggested to him, was set forth thousands of years ago as
the only righteous one.</p>

<p>But this is not by any means the end of the matter.
Even if the social reformers of our day could restore
society to the conditions set forth so emphatically and
so long ago in Israel, history proves that nothing more
than a temporary improvement might be accomplished.
In Israel, as we have seen, with the decay of religion
came the decay of this righteous social state. Human
selfishness then shook off the curb of religion, and gave
itself without restraint to the oppression of the poor.
Have we any reason to believe that now human selfishness
would do less? There appears little ground to
think so; and though we may believe that without the
acceptance of Deuteronomic principles in modern life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
we cannot restrain the growth of poverty, even with
Deuteronomic principles embodied in our laws nothing
will be done if the people turn their backs upon religion,
make selfish enjoyment their highest good, and the
comforts and pleasures of a merely material life their
only heart-warming aspiration. In that fact we have
an indication of the true functions of the Church and of
religious teachers in the social and political life of our
time and of times to come. As individuals, religious men
should certainly be found always among the advocates of
all laws and plans which tend to justice and mercy,
and to the raising of the toilers everywhere to a higher
standard of living. Further, at no time should the Church
be found committed to a purely conservative policy, of
retaining things as they are. The undeniable facts as to
the condition of the poor are so utterly unjustifiable, that
to leave things as they are is to fall into the treason
of despair in regard to the future of our race, and
into scarcely veiled disbelief of the essential truth of
Christianity. No Church whose heart has not been
corrupted by worldliness can think for a moment that the
present state of things in all highly civilised communities
is even tolerable. It cannot last, and it ought not to last;
the Church that timidly supports it, lest worst things
should come, is named and known thereby for recreant
to Christ and to the highest hopes of His Gospel. But,
on the other hand, it is only in very exceptional circumstances,
and for short intervals, that the Churches and their
ministers can ever be called upon to make the external,
material condition of the people their first and chief care.
They have a place of their own to fill, a function of their
own to discharge; and upon their efficiency and diligence
in these the stability and permanence of all that politicians
and publicists can accomplish ultimately depends. They
must keep alive and nourish the religious life, as that life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
has been shaped and constituted by our Lord Jesus
Christ. Their province is to witness, in season and out
of season, for a life of purity and love, for the Divine and
ideal sides of things, for the necessity, for man's highest
well-being, of a life hid with Christ in God. If they do
not keep up this testimony, no others will; and if it be
dropped out of sight, then the social agony and struggle,
the patriotic and humanitarian strivings of all the reformers,
will lack their final sanction. Men will inevitably
come to think that man's life does consist in the abundance
of the things that he possesses, the leisure, the amusement,
the culture which by combining material resources he
may attain to. But it is to deny and denounce that view
that the Church exists in the world. It was to lift men
out of it, to set them above it for ever, that Christ died.
It is finally only by abandoning it that the highest social
condition can be reached and made permanent for the
multitudes of men. In no way therefore can the Church
so dangerously betray the cause of the poor and the
oppressed as by plunging into the heat of the social and
political struggle. She has to witness to higher things
than that involves, and her silence in the ideal region
which would certainly follow her devotion to material
interests, however unselfish, would be but ill compensated
for by any imaginable success she might attain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3><i>JUSTICE IN ISRAEL</i></h3>


<p>Among the nations of the modern world one of the
most vital distinctions is the degree in which just
judgment is estimated and provided for. Indeed, according
to modern ideas, life is tolerable only where all men
are equal before the law; where all are judged by statutes
which are known, or at least may be known, by all;
where corruption or animus in a judge is as rare as it
is held to be dishonourable. But we cannot forget that
in the majority of even the more advanced countries
of the world these three conditions are not yet found,
and that where they do exist they are only recent acquirements.
In the latest born, and in many respects the most
advanced of the great commonwealths, in the United
States of America, the corruption of a number of the
inferior courts is undeniable, and is tolerated with a most
disappointing patience by the people. In England Judge
Jeffries is no very remote memory, and Lord Bacon's
acceptance of presents from litigants in his court has only
been made more certain by recent investigations. An
absolutely honest intention to give even-handed justice
to all is, therefore, even in England, only a recent attainment,
and in no country is the honest intention always
successful in realising itself. But if this be so among the
civilised nations of the West, we may say that in Oriental
countries there has been little of systematic and continuous
effort to give even-handed justice at all. Yet nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
has the sinfulness and the destructiveness of corruption in
judgment been more impassionedly and more frequently
set forth by the highest authorities in religion and morals,
than in the East. Tupper, our most recent authority,
in writing of <cite>Our Indian Protectorate</cite>, p. 289, describes
the Indian attitude to law thus: "There was not that
reverence for law which in Europe is in all probability
very largely due to the influence of the Roman law, and
to the teaching of the Roman Catholic and other Christian
Churches. So far as there was a germ out of which the
respect for law ought to have grown, it was to be found
in dislike to actions plainly opposed to custom and tradition.
There was a deeply rooted and widespread conviction that
there could be no rule to which exceptions could not be
made, if agreeable to the discretion of the chief or any of
his delegates. The chief was set above the law; it did
not limit his authority by any constitution. There was
no legislation for the improvement of law. The administration
of justice was extremely imperfect." The same
writer describes the result of such a state of mind in his
picture of Mahratta rule (p. 247). "There was," he says,
"no prescribed form of trial. Men were seized on slight
suspicions. Presumptions of guilt were freely made.
Torture was employed to compel confession. Prisoners
for theft were often whipped at intervals to make them
discover where the stolen property was hidden. <em>Ordinarily
no law was referred to except in cases affecting religion.</em>"
That there were both Hindu codes and Mohammedan codes
in existence which claimed and were believed to have
Divine authority made no difference in India. Nor does
it make any in Persia to-day.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Now, in coming to the consideration of the views of
justice embodied in Old Testament law, and the quality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the judiciary in ancient Israel, we must take not Western
but Eastern ideas as our standard. Judging from that point
of view, it should create no prejudice in our minds if we
find on the first glance that all men were not equal before
the ancient law of Israel; that for a considerable period,
if not during the whole political existence of Israel, there
was no very extensive written law; and that arbitrary and
corrupt judgment was only too common at all times. For
none of these defects would indicate in ancient Israel the
same evils as similar defects in nations of our time would
indicate. They are rather defects in the process of being
overcome, than defects arising from feeble or vitiated life.
If there was a constant movement towards the highest
state of things, that is all we can demand or expect to find.</p>

<p>Now there does seem to have been that. As has been
well pointed out by Dr. Oort,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in the tribes which became
Israel justice must have been administered by the heads
of the various bodies which went to make these up. The
household was ruled even in matters of life and death
solely by the father; the family, in the wider sense, was
judged by its own heads; the tribes by the elders of the
tribes, and there probably was no appeal from one tribunal
to another. Each tribunal was final in its own domain.
It may be, also, that the judicial function was in all these
bodies exercised in the lax and timid fashion common
among Bedouin tribes to-day.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In all cases, too, it is probable
that in the pre-Mosaic time the standard of judgment
was customary law. Only with this very great modification
can Oort's epigrammatic description of the situation&mdash;"There
was no law, but there were givers of legal
decisions"&mdash;be accepted. So far as can be ascertained, the
customs according to which men were expected to live
were perfectly well known, and within certain narrow limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
of variation were extraordinarily stable. How stable
customary law may be made, even in the midst of a society
governed in the main according to written law in its
strictest sense, may be seen in the execration which any
breach of the Ulster custom of tenant right met with, before
that custom was embodied in any statutes. And in
antiquity the stringency of custom can hardly be exaggerated.
Under it, when thoroughly established, there was,
in all the cases covered by it, only this one way of acting
for all, both men and women, who were fit for society at
all. Any alternative course was probably inconceivable
in the tribal stage of the Israelites' existence.</p>

<p>But a change would doubtless be wrought whenever the
appointment of a king took place. Then national law
would appear, in embryo at least; and at first, until custom
had grown up in this region also, it would largely be an
expression of the will of the king, and of the royal officers
instructed and trained by the king. But it would have
free and unchallenged course only when it claimed
authority in matters lying outside of the family and tribal
jurisdictions. Wherever it attempted to interfere with
tribal or family rights, danger to the kingship of the most
acute kind would be sure to arise. In all probability, it
was disregard of this axiomatic truth which made Solomon's
reign so burdensome to the people and tore the kingdom
asunder under Rehoboam. Ahab too fell a victim to his
disregard of it. Lastly, the introduction of elaborate
written codes of law would, if it came as the crown of such
a development, depose custom from its supremacy, though
it would not abolish it; and would substitute for it as the
main element in all judicial matters the written prescription,
which is the necessary presupposition of a fully organised
judiciary of the modern type, with a regulated and definite
power of appeal.</p>

<p>But in the case of ancient Israel there is a distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
element which has to be fitted into this ordinary
scheme of progression, and that is the Divine revelation to
Moses. Taken up at the tribal stage by the Mosaic
revelation, the Israelite tribes were touched and welded
into coherence, if not quite as a nation, at least as the
people of Yahweh, so that during all the distracting days
of the Judges they kept up in essentials their social and
religious unity.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> And with the religious union there must
have come administrative uniformity to some considerable
extent. The jurisdiction of the heads of households, of
heads of families, and of the tribal elders would be as little
interfered with as possible; but, as we have seen, all
customs and rights had to be reviewed from the point of
view of the new religion, and appeal to Moses as the
prophet of it must have often been unavoidable. Just as
his first followers were continually coming to Mohammed,
to ask whether this or that ancient custom could be followed
by professors of Islam, so there must have been constant
appeals to Moses. So long as he lived, therefore, he, and
after him Joshua and Moses' fellow-tribesmen the sons of
Levi, as being specially zealous for the religion of Yahweh,
must have been constantly called in to assist the customary
judges; and so the habit of appeal must have grown
in Israel long before there was any king. Thus also a
common standard of judgment would be established.
That standard must necessarily have been the law of
Yahweh, <i>i.e.</i> the new Yahwistic principles and all that might
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> be deduced from them, together with so much
of custom and tradition as had been accepted as compatible
with these principles. We have stated the reasons for
holding that the Decalogue was Mosaic, and the Book of the
Covenant may be taken also to represent what the current
law in Mosaic or sub-Mosaic time was held to be. As Oort
well says (<i>loc. cit.</i>), when we know that the Hittites about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the middle of the fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small> concluded a treaty
with Rameses II. of Egypt the terms of which were written
upon a silver plate, "why may there not also have been
written statements regarding the mutual rights and duties
of the people of a town, engraved upon stone or metal,
and set forth openly for inspection?" What he confines
to mere town business and refers to the time of the
Judges, we may without risk extend to a general fundamental
law like the Decalogue, or even to the Book of the
Covenant, and date it in the time of Moses. Writing
was so common an accomplishment in Canaan before the
Exodus, that such a supposition is not in the least
improbable. These written laws formed the crown of the
law of Yahweh, and by them all the rest was raised to a
higher level and transformed.</p>

<p>As new men, new times, and new difficulties arose,
the priest became the special organ of Divine direction.
It may be that the priestly Torah was largely the result
of the sacred lot; but the questions that were put, and
the manner in which they were put, would be decided
ultimately by the conception the priest had of the truth
about God. The teaching of the Decalogue would therefore
be the dominant and formative power in all that was
spoken by the priest and for Yahweh. In the disorganised
state into which Israel fell during the time of the
Judges, when, as Deuteronomy takes for granted, and
as 1 Kings iii. 2 and 3 asserts, the legitimate worship of
Yahweh was carried on at many centres, the substantial
sameness of the tradition as to the history of Israel, in
all the varied forms in which we encounter it, is proof
sufficient that at each of the great sanctuaries (which were
certainly in the hands of Levitical priests) the treasure of
ancient knowledge, both in law and history, was carefully
and accurately preserved.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> New decisions would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
given, but they came through men penetrated with the
high thoughts of God, and of His people's destiny, which
Moses had so fruitfully set forth. This was the element
in the life of the people which all the higher minds strove
to perpetuate, and, being spiritual, it spiritualised and
raised all accessory things. Consequently there was,
long before the kingship, what was equivalent to a
national feeling of the highest kind, and the conception
of justice and its administration corresponded to that.</p>

<p>In the Book of the Covenant, which in this matter
represents so early a period that there is no mention of
"judges," only of Pelilim,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> <i>i.e.</i> arbitrators (Exod. xxi. 22),
so that the tribal and family heads can alone have
exercised judicial functions, we find the most solemn
warnings against any legal perversion of right to gain
popularity, against yielding to the vulgar temptation to
oppress the poor, or to the subtler and, for generous
minds, more insidious temptation, to give an unjust
judgment out of pity for the poor. Israel was, moreover,
to keep far from bribery, "which blindeth them that have
sight, and perverteth righteous causes." In no way was
the law to be used for criminal or oppressive purposes.
From the very first, therefore, in Israel the higher
principles of faith and life set themselves to combat <i>√†
outrance</i> the tendency to unjust judgment, which seems
now, at least, quite ineradicable in the East, save among
the Bedouin.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>A still higher note is struck in the repetition of the law
in the Book of Deuteronomy. In chap. i., originally part
of a historic introduction to the book proper, we read:
"Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge
righteously between a man and his brother, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
stranger that is with him. Ye shall not respect persons
in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike;
ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment
(<i>i.e.</i> the whole judicial process and function) is God's; and
the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me
(Moses), and I will hear it." Yes, the judgment is God's.
Just as the whole of moral duty towards man was raised
by the Decalogue to a new and more intimate relation with
God, so here justice, the fundamental necessity of a
sound and stable political state, is lifted out of the
conflict of mean and selfish motives, in which it must
eventually go down, and is set on high as a matter in
which the righteous God is supremely concerned. In
this, as in all things, Israel was called to a lonely eminence
of ideal perfection by the character of the God whom they
were bound to serve. Therefore it strikes us with no
surprise that justice is insisted upon almost with passion
in Deut. xvii. 20: "Justice, justice shalt thou pursue
after, that thou mayest live and possess the land which
Yahweh thy God giveth thee"; or that it is made one
of the conditions of Israel's permanence as a nation. In
chap. xxiv. 17 we read, "Thou shalt not wrest the judgment
of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take the widow's
raiment to pledge"; in xxv. 1 and 2, "If there be a plea
between men, ... then they (<i>i.e.</i> the judges) shall justify
the righteous and condemn the wicked." For any other
course of conduct would bring guilt upon the nation in
the sight of Yahweh; and how jealously that was guarded
against is seen in the sacrifice and ritual imposed for the
purification of the people from the guilt of a murder the
perpetrator of which was unknown (Deut. xxi. 1-9).
Unatoned for and disregarded, such a crime brought
disturbance into those relations between Israel and their
God upon which their very existence as a nation depended;
and the disregard of justice, where wrongs were committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
by known persons and were left unpunished, was of
course more deadly. So the author of Deuteronomy
looked upon it; and the prophets, from the first of them to
the last, brand unjust judgment, the perverting the course
of legal justice, as the most alarming sign of national decay.
The righteous God, with whom there was no respect of
persons, could not permanently favour a people whose
judges and rulers disregarded righteousness; and when
destruction actually came upon this people, it was proclaimed
to be God's doing, "because there was no truth
nor justice nor knowledge of God in the land."</p>

<p>Nowhere in the world, therefore, has the demand for
justice been made more central than here, and nowhere
has injustice been more passionately fought against. Nor
have the sanctions binding to a pursuit of justice been at
any period more nobly or more vividly conceived. In
this main point, therefore, Israel's law stands irreproachable&mdash;marvellously
so, considering its great antiquity. But
we have still to inquire whether any really adequate
provision was made for the general and inexpensive administration
of justice. To take the latter first, law was
in old Israel probably <em>as cheap</em> as it would be in the
primitive East to-day, if bribery were to be stopped. To
advise as to the sacred law, to plead for justice according
to it, did not then, and does not now in similar circumstances,
belong to any special professional class who live
by it. The priest could be appealed to freely by all; and
the heads of fathers' houses, as well as the tribal heads,
were, by the very fact that they were such, bound to give
judgment among their people, and to appear for and take
responsibility for them when they had a cause with
persons beyond the limits of the particular families and
tribes. Justice, consequently, was in ordinary circumstances
perfectly free to all.</p>

<p>And from a very early time earnest efforts were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
to make it equally <em>accessible</em>. At first, when the people
were in one army or train, before they came to Sinai, an
overwhelming burden was laid upon Moses. As the
prophet of the new dispensation all difficulties were
brought to him. But at Jethro's suggestion, as JE tells us
in Exod. xviii. 13 ff., and as Deuteronomy repeats in chap.
i. 16, he chose men of each tribe, or took the heads of
each tribe, and set them as captains of thousands and
hundreds and fifties and tens. Not improbably this was
primarily a military organisation, but to these captains
was committed also jurisdiction over those under them.
In all ordinary cases they judged them and their families
in the spirit of Yahwism, as well as commanded them;
and in this way, as has already been pointed out, the
customary law was revised in accordance with Yahwistic
principles. Justice too was brought to every man's door.
The only question that suggests itself is, whether these
captain-judges were the ordinary family and tribal heads,
organised for this purpose by Moses. On the whole
this would seem to have been so, and it may well be
that Jethro's suggestion had in view the danger of ignoring
them, as well as the burden which Moses' sole judgeship
laid upon him. But with the advance to the conquest of
Canaan a new situation emerged, and the probability is
that more and more, as the tribes fell into entire or semi-isolation,
the tribal organisation in its natural shape
would come to the front again. Deuteronomy, however,
tells us little if anything of this. In the main passage
regarding this matter (xvii. 8-13), where provision is
made for an appeal to a central court, the legislation is
entirely for a period much later than Moses. Like the
law regarding sacrifice at one altar, the judicial provisions
of Deuteronomy seem all to be bound up with the
place which Yahweh shall choose, viz. the Solomonic
Temple in Jerusalem. We may consequently conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
that the judicial arrangements to which Deuteronomy
alludes existed only after the Israelite kingship had been
for some time established at Jerusalem. We have no
distinct evidence for the existence of a central high court
in David's days; and from the story of Absalom's rebellion
we should gather that the old, simple Oriental method
still prevailed, according to which the king, like the heads
of tribes, families, etc., judged every one who came to him,
personally, at the gate of the royal city. But Samuel
is said in 1 Sam. vii. 16 to have annually gone on circuit
to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. According to the school
of Wellhausen, nearly the whole of this chapter is the
work of a Deuteronomic writer about the year 600. In
that case, of course, it would be difficult to prove that the
arrangement attributed to Samuel was not a mere echo
of what was done in Josiah's day; though, if the Deuteronomic
prescriptions were carried out then, there would
be no need for such a system. On the other hand, if
Budde and Cornill be right in tracing the chapter back
to JE, this habit of going on circuit must have been an
ancient one, possibly dating from Samuel's time. That
this latter view is the correct one is in a degree confirmed
by the statement in viii. 2 that Samuel's sons were
installed by him as judges in Israel, at Beersheba. This
belongs to E, and it would seem to indicate the beginnings
of such a system as Deuteronomy presupposes.</p>

<p>But it is only in the days of Jehoshaphat (873-849
B.C.) that an arrangement like that in Deuteronomy is
mentioned. From 2 Chron. xix. 5 ff. we learn that "he
set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities
of Judah, city by city. Moreover in Jerusalem did
Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and of the priests, and of
the heads of the fathers' houses, for the judgment of
Yahweh and for controversies." Further, it is stated
that Amariah the chief priest was set over the judges in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
Jerusalem in all Yahweh's matters, <i>i.e.</i> in all religious
questions, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael the prince of
the house of Judah in all the king's matters, <i>i.e.</i> in all
secular affairs. Of course few advanced critics will admit
that the Books of Chronicles are reliable in such matters.
But that judgment is altogether too sweeping, and here
we would seem to have a well-authenticated record of
what Jehoshaphat actually did.</p>

<p>For it will be observed, that when we take up the
various notices in regard to the administration of justice,
we have a well-defined progress from Moses to Jehoshaphat.
Moses was chief judge and committed ordinary cases to
the tribal and family heads who were chosen as military
leaders, each judging his own detachment. After passing
the Jordan, the whole matter would seem to have fallen
back into the hands of the tribal heads, with the occasional
help of the heroes who delivered and judged Israel. At
the end of this period Samuel, as head of the State, went
on circuit, and appointed his sons judges in Beersheba,
thus initiating a new system, which, had it been successful,
might have superseded the tribal and family heads
altogether. But it was a failure, and was not repeated.
With the rise of the kingship the courts received further
organisation. If the Chronicler can be trusted, Levites to
the number of six thousand were appointed to be judges
and Shoterim. The number seems excessive; but the
appointment of Levites to act as assessors with the tribal
and other heads would be a natural expedient for a king
like David to have recourse to, if he desired to secure
uniformity of judgment, and to bring the courts under
his personal influence. The next step would naturally
be that which is attributed to Jehoshaphat, and it is
precisely that which Deuteronomy points to as being
already at work in his time. We have, consequently,
more than the late authority of the Chronicler for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Jehoshaphat's high court. The probabilities of the
case point so strongly to the rise of some such judicial
system about that period, that it would require some
positive proof, not mere negative suspicion, to lead us to
reject the narrative. In any case this must have been
the system in Josiah's day, and afterwards. For when
Jeremiah was arraigned for prophesying destruction to
the Temple and to Jerusalem, the process against him
was conducted on similar lines to those laid down in
Deuteronomy. The princes judged, the priests (curiously
enough along with the false prophets) made the charge,
<i>i.e.</i> stated that the prophet's conduct was worthy of death,
and the princes acquitted. During the Exile it is probable
that the "elders" of the people were permitted to judge
them in all ordinary cases, but we have no certain proof
that this was so. After the return from Babylon, however,
the local courts were re-established, probably in the very
form in which they appear in the New Testament (Matt.
v. 22, x. 17; Mark xiii. 9; Luke xii. 14-58).</p>

<p>Throughout the whole history of Israel, therefore, courts
of justice were easily accessible to every man, whether
he were rich or poor. No doubt the free, open-air,
Eastern manner of administering justice was favourable
to that; but from the days of Moses onward we have
fairly conclusive proof that the leaders of the people made
it their continual care that wherever a wrong was suffered
there should be some court to which an appeal for redress
could be made.</p>

<p>The justice aimed at in Israel was, therefore, <em>impartial</em>
and <em>accessible</em>. We have still to inquire whether it was
<em>merciful</em> or cruel in its infliction of punishment. Dr. Oort
says it was a hard law in this respect, but one is at a loss
to see how that view can be sustained. There is no mention
of torture in connection with legal proceedings, either
in the history or in the legislation. Nor is there any instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
mentioned in which an accused person was imprisoned
until he confessed. Indeed imprisonment would not appear
to have been a legal punishment in Israel, nor in any antique
state. The idea of providing maintenance for those who had
offended against the law was one which could never have
occurred to any one in antiquity. Prisons are, of course, frequently
mentioned in Scripture; but they were used, up to
the time of Ezra, only for the safe-keeping of persons
charged with crime till they could be brought before the
judges. Sometimes, as in the case of the prophets, men
were imprisoned to prevent them from stirring up the
people; but this procedure was nowhere sanctioned by law.
Further, the crimes for which the punishment prescribed
in the ancient law was death were few. Idolatry, adultery,
unnatural lust, sorcery, and murder or manslaughter,
together with striking or cursing parents and kidnapping&mdash;these
were all. Considering that idolatry and sorcery
were high treason in its worst forms, so far as this people
was concerned, and that impurity threatened the family
in a much more direct and immediate fashion then than it
does now, while the people were naturally inclined to it,
one must wonder that the list of capital crimes is so short.
Contrast this with Blackstone's statement in regard to
England (quoted <cite>Ency. Brit.</cite>, iv., p. 589): "Among the
variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit,
no less than one hundred and sixty have been declared
by Act of Parliament to be felonies without benefit of
clergy, or, in other words, to be worthy of instant death."
It is only in comparatively recent years that the punishment
of death has been practically restricted to murder
in England. Yet that is almost the case in the ancient
Jewish law; for the exceptions are such as would reappear
in England if it were more sparsely populated
and manners were rougher. In Australia, for example,
highway robbery under arms and violence to women are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
capital crimes, just because the country is sparsely inhabited
and the households unprotected. Nor were the modes
of death inflicted cruel. Only three&mdash;viz. impalement,
and burning, and stoning&mdash;appear to be so. But it may
be believed that in the cases contemplated by the law
death in some less painful manner had preceded the
two former, as is certainly the case in Josh. vii. 15 and
25, and in Deut. xxi. 22. As for the latter, it must have been
horrible to look upon, but in all probability the criminal's
agony was rarely a prolonged one. The other method
of execution, by the sword namely, was humane enough.
Dr. Oort tells us that mutilations were common; but his
proof is only this, that in the treaty between the Hittite
king and Rameses II. we read, concerning inhabitants
of Egypt who have fled to the land of the Hittites and
have been returned, "His mother shall not be put to death;
he shall not be punished in his eyes, nor on his mouth,
nor on the soles of his feet." The same provision is
made for Hittite fugitives. From this evidence of the
custom of surrounding peoples, and from the fact that
the <i>jus talionis</i> is announced in the Scriptures by the
familiar formula, "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for
hand, foot for foot," Dr. Oort draws this conclusion. But
he appears to forget that the <i>jus talionis</i> was common to
almost all the peoples of the ancient world, and is referred
to in the Pentateuch, not as a new principle, but as a
custom coming down from immemorial time. Consequently,
though there must once have been a time in
which it was carried out in its literal form, that time
probably was past when the laws referring to it were
written. In Rome, and probably in other lands where
this custom existed, it early gave place to the custom of
giving and receiving money payments. Most probably
this was the case in Israel, at least from the time of the
Exodus. For the new religion introduced by Moses was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
merciful. But these references to the principle of retaliation
tell us nothing as to the frequency or otherwise of mutilation
as a punishment. No instance of mutilation being inflicted
either as a retaliation or as a punishment occurs in the
Old Testament, and the probability is that cases were
never numerous. Apart from retaliation they are never
mentioned; and we may, I think, set it down as one of
the distinctive merits of the Israelite law that it never was
betrayed into sanctioning the cutting off of hands or feet
or ears or noses as general punishment for crime. But
so far as the principle of the <i>lex talionis</i> was retained, its
effect was wholesome. It was a continual reminder that
all free Israelites were equals in the sight of Yahweh.
And not only so, it enforced as well as asserted equality.
Any poor man mutilated by a rich man could demand the
infliction of the same wound upon his oppressor. He could
reject his excuses, and refuse his money, and bring home
to him the truth that they had equal rights and duties.</p>

<p>In this way this seemingly harsh law helped to lay
the foundation for our modern conception of humanity,
which regards all men as brethren. For the teaching
of our Lord, which fulfilled all that the polity and religion
of ancient Israel had foreshadowed of good, broke down
the walls of partition between Jew and Gentile, and made
all men brethren by revealing to them a common Father.
It surely is strange and sad that those who specially
make liberty, equality, and fraternity their watchwords,
have received so false an impression of the religion of
both the Old and New Testaments, that they pride themselves
on rejecting both. When all is said, the levelling
of barriers which the crushing weight of Roman power
brought about, and the common methods and elements
of thought which the Greek conquests had spread all over
the civilised world, would never have made the brotherhood
of man the universally accepted doctrine it is. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
truths which made it credible came from the revelation
given by God to His chosen people, and its final and
conclusive impulse was given to it by the lips of
Christ.</p>

<p>In face of that cardinal fact it is vain to point out
as one of the defects of this law that all men were not
equal before it. Women were not equal with men, nor
were foreigners nor slaves equal with freeborn Israelites;
but the seed of all that later times were to bring was
already there. The principles which at the long end of
the day have abolished slavery, raised women to the
equal position they now occupy, and made peace with
foreigners increasingly the desire of all nations, had their
first hold upon men given them here. In all these
directions the Mosaic law was epoch-making. In the
fifth commandment, as well as in the legislation regarding
the punishment of a rebellious son, the mother is put upon
the same level as the father. However subordinate
woman's position in the larger public life might be, within
the home she was to be respected. There, in her true
domain, she was man's equal, and was acknowledged to
have an equal claim to reverence from her children.</p>

<p>In precisely the same way the "stranger" was freed
from disability and protected. In the earliest days, when
the Israelite community was still being formed, whole
groups of strangers were received into it and obtained full
rights, as for example the Kenites and Kenizzites. But
though this was a promise of what Israel was ultimately
to be to the world, the necessities of the situation, the need
to keep intact the treasure of higher religion which was
committed to this people, compelled the adoption of a more
separatist policy. Yet "in no other nation of antiquity
were strangers received and treated with such liberality
and humanity as in Israel." They were freely afforded
the protection of the law; they were, in short, received as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
"a kind of half-citizens, with definite rights and duties."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Further, though the ger was not bound to all the religious
practices and rites of the Israelite, yet he was permitted,
and in some cases commanded, to take part in their
religious worship. If he consented to circumcise all his
house he might even share in the Passover feast. All
oppression of such an one was also rigorously forbidden,
and to a large extent the stranger shared in the benefits
conferred by the provision for the poor of the land which
the law made compulsory.</p>

<p>Nor was the case otherwise with slaves. Equality
there was not, and could not be; but in the provisions
for the emancipation of the Israelite slave and
the introduction of penalties for undue harshness, it
began to be recognised that the slave stood, in some
degree at least, on the same level as his master&mdash;he too
was a man.</p>

<p>Taking it as a whole, therefore, the ancient world will
be searched in vain for any legislation equal to this
in the "promise and the potency" of its fundamental
ideas as to justice. Here, as nowhere else, we can see
the radical principles which should dominate in the
administration of justice laying hold upon mankind, and
that there was a living will and power behind these
principles is shown in the steady movement toward something
higher which characterised Israelite law. In the
pursuit of impartiality, accessibility, and humanity, the
teachers of Israel were untiring, and the sanctions by
which they surrounded and guarded all that tended to
make the administration of justice effective in the high
sense were unusually solemn and powerful. The result
has been most remarkable. All the ages of civilised men
since have been the heirs of Israel in this matter. Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
influence and the influence of the Christian Church have
no doubt been powerful, and the manifold exigencies of
life have drawn out and made explicit much which was
only implicit in the ancient days. But the higher qualities
of our modern administration of justice can be traced back
step by step to Biblical principles, and the course of
development laid bare. When that is done, it is seen
that the almost ideal purity and impartiality of the best
modern tribunals is the completion of what the Israelite
law and methods began. In this one instance at least
the great Mosaic principles have come to fruition; and
from the security and peace, the contentment and the
confidence, with which impartial justice has filled the
minds of men, we can estimate how potent to cure the ills
of our social and moral state the realisation of the other
great Mosaic ideals would be. It should be a source
of encouragement to all who look for a time when "the
kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our
Lord and of His Christ," that something like the ideal of
justice has so far been realised. It has no doubt been a
weary time in coming, and it has as yet but a narrow and
perhaps precarious footing in the world. But it is here,
with its healing and beneficent activity; and in that fact we
may well see a pledge that all the rest of the Divinely
given ideals for the Kingdom of God will one day be
realised also. Such a consummation, however remote it
may seem to our human impatience, however devious and
winding the paths by which alone it can draw near, will
come most surely, and in our approach to the ideal in our
judicial system we may well see the firstfruits of a
richer and more plentiful harvest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3><i>LAWS OF PURITY (CHASTITY AND MARRIAGE)</i></h3>


<p>In dealing with the ten commandments it has been
already shown that, though these great statements
of religious and moral truth were to some extent inadequate
as expressions of the highest life, they yet contained the
living germs of all that has followed. But we cannot
suppose that the reality of Israelite life from the first
corresponded with them. They contained much that only
the experience and teaching of ages could fully bring
to light; therefore we cannot expect that the actual laws
in regard to the relations of the sexes and the virtue
of chastity should stand upon the same high level as
the Decalogue. The former represent the reality, this
the ultimate ideal of Israelite law on these subjects. But
neither is unimportant in forming an estimate of the value
of the revelation given to Israel, and of the moral condition
of early Israel itself, nor can either be justly viewed
altogether alone. The actual law at any moment in the
history of Israel must be regarded as inspired and upborne
by the ideal set forth in the ten commandments.
But it must, at the same time, be a very incomplete
realisation of these, and its various stages will be best
regarded as instalments of advance towards that comparative
perfection.</p>

<p>In regard to the relations of the sexes and the virtue
of purity this must be peculiarly the case. For though
chastity has been safeguarded by almost all nations up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
to a certain low point, it has never been really cherished by
any naturalistic system. Nor has it ever been favoured
by mere humanism.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Consequently there is no point of
morals in regard to which man has more conspicuously
failed to work out the merely animal impulse from his
nature than in this. And yet, for all the higher ends
of life, as well as for the prosperity and vigour of mankind,
purity in the sexual relations is entirely vital. One
great cause of the decay of nations, nay, even of civilisations,
has been the abandonment of this virtue. This
was the main cause of the destruction of the Canaanites.
It may even be said to have been the cause of the wreck
of the whole ancient world. We should consequently
measure what the Mosaic influence did for purity of life,
not by comparing early Israelite laws with what has been
accomplished by Christianity, but with the condition of
the Semitic peoples surrounding Israel, in and after the
Mosaic times.</p>

<p>What that was we know. Their religions, far from
discouraging sexual immorality, made it a part of their
holiest rites. Both men and women gave themselves
up to natural and unnatural lusts, in honour of their gods.
To the north, and south, and east, and west of Israel these
practices prevailed, and as a natural result the moral
fabric of these nations' life fell into utter ruin. In private
life adultery, and the still more degrading sin of Sodom
were common. The man had a right to indiscriminate
divorce and remarriage, and marriage connections now
reckoned incestuous, such as those between brother and
sister, were entirely approved. In all these points Israel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
as a nation was without reproach. The higher teaching
this people had received in respect to the character of
God, and it may be some reminiscence of Egyptian custom,
which was in some respects purer than that of the Semitic
peoples, raised them to a higher level. Yet in the main
the early Israelite view of women was fundamentally the
uncivilised one.</p>

<p>But at all periods of Israelite history, even the earliest,
women had asserted their personality. In the eye of the
law they might be the chattels of their male relatives, but
as a fact they were dealt with as persons, with many
personal rights. They had no independent position in
the community, it is true. They could take no part in
a festival so important as the Passover, nor were they
free to make vows without the consent of their husbands.
In other ways also social restraints were laid upon them.
Nevertheless their position in early Israel was much
higher than it is in the East to-day, and their liberty was
in no wise unreasonably abridged. In David's day women
could appear in public to converse with men without
scandal.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> They also took part in religious festivals and
processions, giving life to them by beating their timbrels,
by singing, and by dancing.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> They could be present also
at all ordinary sacrifices and at sacrificial feasts; and, as
we see in the case of Deborah and others, they could
occupy a high, almost a supreme, position as prophetesses.
In the main, too, the relations between husband and wife
were loving and respectful, and in Israel's best days,
when the people still remained landed yeomanry, the wife,
by her industry within the house, supplemented and completed
her husband's labour in the fields. The Israelite
woman was consequently a very important person in the
community, whatever her status in law might be; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
she had not the full rights which are now granted to her
sex in Western and Christian lands, her position was for
the times a noble and independent one. That all this
was so was largely due to the improvements which
Mosaism wrought on the basis of that ancient Semitic
custom which we sketched at the beginning of this chapter,
and with which it seems natural to suppose the Israelite
tribes had also begun.</p>

<p>Bearing these preliminary considerations in mind, we
now go on to consider the actual legislation in regard to
the relations of the sexes. But here we must once more
recall the fact that, in regard to all matters vitally affecting
the community, there had always been a custom, and even
before written law appears that custom had been adopted
and modified in Yahwism by Moses himself. That this
was actually the case here is rendered highly probable
by the history of legislation in this matter. In the Book of
the Covenant there is no mention of sexual sin, save in one
passage (Exod. xxii. 16), where the penalty for seduction
of a virgin who is not betrothed is that the seducer shall
offer a "<i>mohar</i>" for her, and marry her without possibility
of divorce, if her father consent. If he will not, then the
"<i>mohar</i>" is forfeited to the father nevertheless, as
compensation for the degradation of his daughter. But it
is obvious that there must have been laws or customs
regulating marriage other than this, for without them there
could have been no such crime as is here punished.
Obviously, also, there must have been laws or customs of
divorce. But of what these laws of marriage and divorce
were Exodus gives us no hint. Deuteronomy, the next
code, which on the critical hypothesis arose at a much later
time as a revision of the Book of the Covenant, contains
much more, <i>i.e.</i> it draws out of the obscurity of unwritten
custom a more extensive series of provisions in regard
to purity. The Law of Holiness then adds largely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Deuteronomy, and with it the main points of the law of
purity have attained to written expression. But the influence
of the higher standard set in the Decalogue also makes
itself felt,&mdash;not in the law so much as in the historic books
and the prophets&mdash;and our task now is to trace out first
the legal development, then the prophetical, and to show
how the whole movement culminated and was crowned in
the teaching of Christ.</p>

<p>Beginning then with Deuteronomy, we find that the
chastity of women was surrounded by ample safeguards.
Religious prostitution was absolutely prohibited (Deut.
xxiii. 18). Further, if any violence was done to a
woman who had been betrothed, the punishment of the
wrong was death; if done to a woman who was not
betrothed, the wrong was atoned for by payment of fifty
shekels of silver to her father, and by offering marriage
without possibility of divorce. If marriage was refused,
then the fifty shekels was retained by the father in consideration
of the wrong done him. When the woman
was a sharer in the guilt the punishment in all cases was
death; while pre-nuptial unchastity, when discovered after
marriage, was punished, as adultery also was, with the
same severity.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In women who were free, therefore,
purity was demanded in Israel as strenuously as it ever
has been anywhere, though in man the only limit to sexual
indulgence was the demand, that in seeking it he should
not infringe upon the father's property in his daughter,
or the husband's in his wife or his betrothed bride.</p>

<p>Admittedly the original underlying motive for this moral
severity was a low one, the mere proprietary rights of the
father or husband. But it would be a mistake to suppose
that purely ethical and religious motives had no place in
establishing the customs or enactments which we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
in Deuteronomy. With the lapse of time higher motives
entwined themselves with the coarse strand of personal
proprietary interest, which had originally, though perhaps
never alone, been the line of limitation. Gradually there
grew up a standard of higher purity; and when Deuteronomy
was written, though the original line was still
clearly visible, it was justified by appeals to a moral sense
which reached far beyond the original motives of the
customary law. The continually recurring burden of
Deuteronomy in dealing with these matters is that to
work "folly in Israel" is a crime for which only the
severest punishment can atone. To "extinguish the evil
from Israel," and to put away such things as were
"abominations to Yahweh their God," are the great
reasons on which the writer of Deuteronomy founds the
claim for obedience in these cases. Obviously, therefore,
by his time, under the teaching of the religion of Yahweh,
Israel had risen to a moral height which took account of
graver interests than the rights of property in legislating for
female purity. The cases included in the law had been
determined by considerations of that kind; but the sanctions
by which the commands were buttressed had entirely
changed their character. The holiness of God and the
dignity of man, the consideration of what alone was
worthy of a "son of Israel," have taken the place of the
coarser sanctions. In this way a possibility of unlimited
moral progress was secured, since the cause of purity
was indissolubly bound to the general and irresistible
advance of religious and moral enlightenment in the chosen
people.</p>

<p>Moreover the personality of the woman was acknowledged
in the entire acquittal of the betrothed woman who
had been exposed to outrage in the country, where her
cries could bring no help. In the earliest times most
probably the punishment of death would have been inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
equally in that case, since the husband's property had
been deteriorated to such a degree as to make it unworthy
of him. But in the Deuteronomic provision quite other
things are drawn into the estimate. The moral guilt of
the person concerned is now the decisive consideration.
The woman has ceased to be a mere chattel, and the full
claims of her personality are in the way to be recognised.
These were great advances, and for these it is vain to
seek for other causes than the persistent upward pressure
of the Mosaic religion. The moral superiority of Israel
at the time of the conquest over the much more cultured
Canaanites, as also over the nomadic tribes to which they
were more nearly related, is due, as Stade says, ultimately
to their religion; and no reader of the Old Testament, in
our time at least, can fail to see that their moral progress
in the land they conquered depended entirely upon the
same cause. At the Deuteronomic epoch purity had already
been placed upon a worthy basis, as a moral achievement
of the first importance, and impurity had taken its proper
place as a degrading sin. But much still remained to
be done before these principles could be extended into
all domains of life equally.</p>

<p>How far they had penetrated in early times may perhaps
best be seen in the Deuteronomic references to
divorce. Before Deuteronomy there is no law of divorce,
nor indeed is there any after it. We may perhaps even
say that there is in it not so much the statement of a
law of divorce, as a reference to custom which the writer
wishes to correct or reinforce in one particular respect
only. Notwithstanding the Jewish view, therefore, which
finds in Deut. xxiv. 1-4 a divorce law, we must adduce
the passage as a new and striking proof of what we have
all along asserted, that neither Deuteronomy nor any other
of the legal codes can be taken as complete statements
of what was legally permitted or forbidden in Israel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
Behind all of them there is a vast mass of unwritten
customary law, and divorce was doubtless always determined
by it. That this was the case will be seen at once
if the passage we are now concerned with be rightly
translated. It runs thus: "When a man taketh a wife
and marrieth her, and it shall be (if she find no favour
in his eyes, because he hath found in her some unseemly
thing) that he writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth
it into her hand, and sendeth her out of his house, and
she go forth out of his house and goeth and becometh the
wife of another man, and if the latter husband also hate
her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her
hand and send her out of his house, or if the latter
husband die who took her to him to wife, then her former
husband who sent her away may not take her again to
be his wife after that she has permitted herself to be
defiled." All the passage provides for, therefore, is that a
divorced woman shall not be remarried to the divorcing
man after she has been married again, even though she
be separated from her second husband by divorce or
death. There is consequently no law of divorce here
stated. There is merely a reference to a general law or
custom by which divorce was permitted for "any unseemly
thing," and according to which a chief wife at any rate
could be divorced only by a "bill of divorcement," and
not by mere word of mouth, as is common in many
Eastern lands to-day. Mosaic influence may have
procured this last slight increase in rigour, and Deuteronomy
certainly adds three other restrictions, viz. that
after remarriage a woman cannot be again married to her
first husband, and that pre-nuptial wrong done to a woman
by her husband, or a false accusation by him after
marriage, takes away his right of divorce altogether. But
the woman has no right of divorce at all, so firmly fixed
throughout all Old Testament time was the belief in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
inferiority of women. On the whole, therefore, divorce
in Israel remained, after the law had dealt with it, much
on the level to which the tribal customs had brought it.
So far as the legislation dealt with it, it tended to restriction;
but when all is said it remains true that the Israelite
<em>law</em> of divorce was in the main much what it would have
been had there been no revelation. But the <em>spirit</em> of the
religion of Yahweh was against laxity in this matter, and
this more rigorous feeling finds expression in the evident
distaste for the remarriage of a divorced woman which
is expressed in Deut. xxiv. 4. Remarriage is not forbidden;
but the woman who remarries is spoken of as
one who has "let herself be defiled." No such expression
could have been used, had not remarriage after divorce
been looked upon as something which detracted from
perfect feminine purity. The legislator evidently regarded
it as the higher way for a divorced woman to remain
unmarried so long at least as the divorcing husband lived.
If she remained so, the possibility of reunion was always
kept open, and the law evidently looked upon the ultimate
annulment of the divorce as the course which was most
consonant with the ideal of marriage.</p>

<p>It is thus clearly seen how our Lord's statement (Matt.
xix. 8)&mdash;"Moses because of the hardness of your hearts
suffered you to put away your wives, but from the
beginning it hath not been so"&mdash;is true.</p>

<p>And when we leave the law and come to history and
prophecy, we find this view to have been a prevalent
one from early times. In one of the earliest connected
historical narratives, that of J (Gen. ii. 24), the union
of husband and wife is said to be so peculiarly intimate
that it makes them one body, so that separation is equivalent
to mutilation. And the prophets remain true to this
conception of marriage, as the one which fitted best into
their deeper and loftier views of morality. From Hosea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
onwards<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> they represent the indissoluble bond between
Yahweh and His people as a marriage relation, founded
on free choice and unchangeable love. The possibility
of divorce is no doubt often admitted, and the conduct of
Israel is represented as justifying that course. But the
prophetic message always is that the love of God will
never permit Him to put away His people; and the people
are often addressed as faithless and faint-hearted, because
they yield to the temptation of believing that He has
cast them off (Isa. l. 1). Evidently, therefore, the prophetic
ideal of marriage was that it should be indissoluble,
that it should be founded upon free mutual love, and that
such a love should make it impossible for either husband
or wife to give the other up, however desperate the errors
of the guilty one might have been.</p>

<p>Perhaps the finest expression of this view occurs in
Isa. liv., in the exhortation addressed to exiled Israel and
beginning "Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear."
There the ideal Israel is urged to lay aside all her fears
with this assurance: "For thy Maker is thine husband;
Yahweh of Hosts is His name: and thy Redeemer, the
Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He
be called. For Yahweh hath called thee as a woman
forsaken and grieved in spirit; how can a wife of youth
be rejected? saith thy God." The full meaning of this
last touching question has been well brought out by
Prof. Cheyne (<cite>Isaiah</cite>, ii., p. 55): "Even many an earthly
husband (how much more then Yahweh!) cannot bear
to see the misery of his divorced wife, and therefore at
length recalls her; and when his wife is one who has been
wooed and won in youth, how impossible is it for her to
be absolutely dismissed." The rising tide of prophetic
feeling on this subject culminates in the pathetic scene
depicted by Malachi, who in chap. ii. 12 ff. reproves his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
people for their cruel and frivolous use of divorce. Drawn
away by love of idolatrous women, they had divorced
their Hebrew wives; and these in their misery crowded
the Temple, covering the altar of Yahweh with "tears and
weeping and sobbing," till He could endure it no more.
He had been witness of the covenant made between each
of these men and the wife of his youth; yet they had
broken this Divinely sanctioned bond. He therefore warns
them to take heed, "for Yahweh the God of Israel saith,
I hate putting away, and him who covers his garment with
violence." The Rabbinic interpreters, not being minded
to give up the privilege of divorce, have wrested these
words into "for Yahweh the God of Israel saith, If he
hate her put her away." But, so wrested, the words bring
down the whole context in one ruin. They are intelligible
only if they denounce divorce, and in this sense they
must undoubtedly be taken.</p>

<p>There remains for consideration, however, a marriage
which the Deuteronomist permits, which seems to run
counter to all the finer feelings and instincts of his later
time. It is dealt with in chap. xxv. 5-10, and is notable
because it is a clear breach of the definite rule that a
man should not marry his deceased brother's wife. But
it will be obvious at once that the permission of this
marriage stands upon quite a different footing from the
prohibition. It is permitted only in a special case for
definite ends; and while the sanction of the prohibition
is the infliction of childlessness (Lev. xx. 21), the man
who refuses to enter upon marriage with his deceased
brother's wife is punished only by being put to shame
by her before the elders of his city. We have not here,
therefore, a law in the strict sense. It is only a recognition
of a very ancient custom which is not yet abolished,
though evidently public feeling was beginning to make
light of the obligation. Its place in the twenty-fifth chapter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
away from the marriage laws (which are given in xxi. 10 ff.,
xxii. 13 ff., and xxiv. 1-4), and among duties of kindness,
seems to hint this, and we may consequently take the law
as a concession. That the custom was ancient in the
time of Deuteronomy may be gathered from the fact that
in Hebrew there is a special technical term, <i>yibbƒìm</i>, for
entering on such a marriage. The probability is, indeed,
that levirate marriage was a pre-Mosaic custom connected
with ancestor-worship. It certainly is practised by many
other races, <i>e.g.</i> the Hindus and Persians, whose religions
can be traced to that source. Under that system, it was
necessary that the male line of descent should be kept
up in order that the ancestral sacrifices might be continued,
and to bear the expense of this the property of the brother
dying childless was jealously preserved. In India, at
present, both purposes are served by adoption, either
by the childless man or by the widow. In earlier times,
when fatherhood was to a large extent a merely juridical
relationship,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> when, that is to say, it was a common thing
for a man to accept as his son any child born of women
under his control, whether he were the father or not, the
same end was also attained by this marriage.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Originating
in this way, the practice was carried over into the Israelite
social life when it changed its form, and the motives for
it were then brought into line with the new and higher
religion. The motive of keeping alive the name and
memory of the childless man was substituted for that
of securing the continuance of his worship; and the purpose
of securing the permanence of property, landed
property especially, in each household, was substituted
for that of supplying means for the sacrifice. Later, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
motive connected with the transmission of property
possibly became the main one. For, since the levirate
marriage came in, according to the strict wording of our
passage, whenever a man died without a son, whether
he had daughters or not, this marriage would seem to
have been an alternative means of keeping the property
in the family to that of letting the daughters inherit.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But
the spirit of the higher religion, as well as a more advanced
civilisation, was unfavourable to it. The custom evidently
was withering when Deuteronomy was written, though in
Judaism it was not disallowed till post-Talmudic times.</p>

<p>The impression, therefore, which the laws and customs
regulating the relations of men and women in Israel give
to the candid student must be pronounced to be a
strangely mixed one. It would probably not be too
much to say that it is at first a deeply disappointing one.
We have been accustomed to fill all the Old Testament
utterances on this subject with the suffused light of Gospel
precept and example, till we have lost sight of the lower
elements undeniably present in the Old Testament laws
and ideas concerning purity. But that is no longer
possible. Whether of enmity or of zeal for the truth,
these less worthy elements have been dragged forth into
the broad light of day, and in that light we are called upon
to readjust our thoughts so as to accept and account for
them. Evidently at the beginning the Israelite tribes
accepted the uncivilised idea of woman. On that as a
basis, however, customs and laws regarding chastity,
marriage and divorce were adopted, which transcended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
and passed beyond that fundamental idea. The moral
complicity of woman, or her innocence, in cases where her
chastity had been attacked, came to be taken into account.
Polygamy, though never forbidden, received grievous
wounds from prophets and others of the sacred writers;
and as marriage with one became more and more the ideal,
the higher teachers of the people kept the indissolubleness of
marriage before the public mind, till Malachi denounced
divorce in Yahweh's name. In regard to the bars to
marriage there was little change, probably, from the days
of Moses; but the old family rules were reinforced by a
deep and delicate regard for even the less palpable
affections and relations which grew up in the home.</p>

<p>The final attainment, therefore, was great and worthy
enough; but the cruder and less refined ideas, which had
been inherited from pre-Mosaic custom, always make
themselves felt, and have even dominated some of the laws.
They dominated, even more, the practice of the people
and the theory of the scribes; so that on the very eve of
His coming who was to proclaim decisively the indissolubility
of marriage, the great Jewish schools were
wrangling whether mere caprice, or some immodesty only,
could justify divorce. Nevertheless the Decalogue, with
its deep and broad command, culminating in prohibition
even of inward evil desire, had always had its own
influence. The teachings of the prophets, which breathe
passionate hatred of impurity, had taught all men of good-will
in Israel that the wrath of God surely burned against
it. But the stamp of imperfection was upon Old Testament
teaching here as elsewhere. Like the Messianic hope,
like the future of Israel, like all Israel's greatest destinies,
the promise of a higher life in this respect was darkened
by the inconsistencies of general practice; and uncertainty
prevailed as to the direction in which men were to
look for the harmonious development of the higher potencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
which were making their presence felt. It was in them
rather than in the law, in the ideals rather than in the
practice of the people, that the hidden power was silently
doing its regenerating work. The religion of Yahweh
in its central content, surrounded all laws and institutions
with an atmosphere which challenged and furthered
growth of every wholesome kind. The axe and hammer
of the legislative builder was rarely heard at work; but
in the silence which seems to some so barren, there
slowly grew a fabric of moral and spiritual ideas and
aspirations, which needed only the coming of Christ to
make it the permanent home of all morally earnest souls.</p>

<p>With Him all that the past generations "had willed,
or hoped, or dreamed of good" came actually to exist.
He made what had been aspiration only the basis of an
actual Kingdom of God. As one of its primary moral
foundations He laid down the radical indissolubility of
marriage, and made visible to all men the breadth of the
law given in the Decalogue by forbidding even wandering
desires. In doing this He completely surpassed all Old
Testament teaching, and set up a standard which Christian
communities as such have held to hitherto, but which from
lack of elevation and earnestness they seem inclined in
these days to let slip. That such a standard was ever set
up was the work of a Divine revelation of a perfectly unique
kind, working through long ages of upward movement.
Humanity has been dragged upwards to it most unwillingly.
Men have found difficulty in living at that height, and
nothing is easier than to throw away all the gain of these
many centuries. All that is needed is a plunge or two
downwards. But if ever these plunges are taken, the
long, slow effort upwards will only have to be begun
again, if family life is to be firmly established, and purity
is to become a permanent possession of men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3><i>LAWS OF KINDNESS</i></h3>


<p>With the commands we now have to consider, we
leave altogether the region of strict law, and enter
entirely upon that of aspiration and of feeling. Kindness,
by its very nature, eludes the rude compulsion of law,
properly so called. It ceases to be kindness when it
loses spontaneity and freedom. Precept, therefore, not
law, is the utmost that any lawgiver can give in respect
to it; and this is precisely what we have in Deuteronomy,
so far as it endeavours to incite men to gentleness, goodness,
and courtesy to one another. The author gives
his people an ideal of what they ought to be in these
respects, and presses it home upon them with the heartfelt
earnestness which distinguishes him. That is all;
but yet, if we are to do justice to him as a lawgiver, we
must consider and estimate the moral value of these
precepts; for, properly speaking, they are the flower of
his legal principles, and they reveal in detail, and therefore,
for the average man, most impressively, the spirit in which
his whole legislation was conceived. In the abstract no
doubt he had told us that love&mdash;love to Yahweh&mdash;was to
be the fundamental thing, and we have seen how deep
and wide-reaching that announcement was. But a review
of the precepts which indicate how he conceived that love
to God should affect men's relations with men, will give
that general principle a definiteness and a concreteness
more impressive than a thousand homilies. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
conception that a relation of love is the only fit relation
between man and God, could not, if it were sincerely
taken up, fail to throw light upon men's true relations to
each other. Consequently the great declaration of the
sixth chapter was bound to re-echo in the precepts to
guide conduct, giving new sanctity and breadth to all
man's duty to his fellows.</p>

<p>Of course the risk of great failure was nigh at hand:
for men may be intellectually convinced that love is the
element in which life ought to be lived, and may proclaim
it, who are far from being actually penetrated and filled
with love, tested and increased by communion with God.
As a result, much talk about love and kindly human duty
has fallen with but little impulsive power upon the hearts
of men. When, however, it is felt to be the expression of
a present experience, such exhortation has power to move
men as no other words can do. And the author of
Deuteronomy was one of those who had this divinely
given secret. In all parts of his book you find his words
becoming winged with power, wherever love to God and
man is even remotely touched upon. If our hypothesis
as to the age in which he lived and wrote be correct,
his must have been one of those high and rare natures
which are not embittered by persecution or contemptuous
neglect. Long before our Lord had spoken His decisive
words on our duty to our neighbour, or St. Paul had
written his great hymn to love, this man of God had been
chosen to feel the truth, and had suffused his book with
it, so that the only principle which can be recognised as
binding together all his precepts is the central principle of
the New Testament. Of course that made his ideal too
high for present realisation; but he gained more than he
lost; for, from Jeremiah and Josiah downwards through
the years, all the noblest of his people responded to him.
The splendour of his thought cast reflections upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
minds, and these glowed and shone amid the meaner
lights which Pharisaism kindled and cherished, till He
came whose right it was to reign. Then Deuteronomy's
true rank was seen; for from it Christ took the answers
by which He repelled Satan in the temptation, and from
it, too, He took that commandment which He called the
first and greatest. Of course the humanity of the book
had not, in expression at least, the imperial sweep of
Christian brotherhood which makes all men equal, so that
for it there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither wise nor
unwise, neither male nor female, neither bond nor free.
But <em>all</em> the chosen people are included in its sympathy;
and in this field, without undue interference with private
life, the author sets forth by specimen cases how the
fraternal feeling should manifest itself in loving, neighbourly
kindness.</p>

<p>As these laws or precepts of kindness are not systematically
arranged, it will be necessary to group them, and we
shall take first those in which it is prescribed that injury
to others should be avoided. Of course criminal wrongs
are not dealt with here. They have already been forbidden
in the strictly legal portions of the book, and
penalties have been attached to them. But in the region
beyond law, there are many acts in which the difference
between a good, and kindly, and sympathetic man, and a
morose, and sullen, and unkindly one, can be even more
clearly seen. In that region Deuteronomy is unmistakably
on the side of sympathy. The poor, the slave, the
helpless should, it teaches, be objects of special care to
the true son of Israel. They should be treated, it shows,
with a generous perception of the peculiar difficulties of
their lot; and pressure upon them at these special points
where their lot is hard should be abhorrent to every
Israelite.</p>

<p>The first in order of the precepts which we are considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
(chap. xxii. v. 8)&mdash;"When thou buildest a new
house, then thou shalt make a railing for thy roof, that
thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall
from thence"&mdash;reveals the fatherly and loving temper
which it is the author's delight to attribute to Yahweh.
As earthly parents guard their children from accidents
and dangers, so Yahweh thinks of possible danger to the
lives of His people, and calls for even minute precautions.
The habit of sitting and sleeping upon the flat roofs of
the houses has always been, and is now, prevalent in the
East. Many accidents take place through this habit. In
recent years Emin Pasha, who ruled so long at Wadelai,
nearly lost his life by one; and here the house-owner is
required in Yahweh's name to minimise that danger, "that
he bring not blood upon his house." The life of each
one of Yahweh's people is precious to Him; therefore it
is that He will have them to guard one another. This is
the principle which runs through all these precepts. In
the sphere of ritual and religion the Deuteronomist does
not transcend Old Testament conditions. For him as for
others it is the nation which is the unit. But in the region
now before us he virtually goes beyond that limitation, and
emphasises the care of Yahweh for the individual, just as in
the demand for love to God he had already made Israel's
relation to their God depend upon each man's personal
attitude. The thought that the Divine care was exerted
over even "such a set of paltry ill-given animalcules as
himself and his nation were," according to Carlyle's phrase,
does not stagger him as it staggered Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>In matters like these, the unsophisticated religion of
the Old Testament is most helpful to us to-day. We
have analysed, and refined, and dimmed all things into
abstractions, God and man among the rest. The fearless
simplicity of the Old Testament restores us to ourselves,
and pours fresh blood into the veins of our religion. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
faith in God as the living orderer of all the circumstances
of our lives can be too strong or too detailed. The
stronger and more definite it becomes, the nearer will it
approach the truth. Only one danger can threaten us
on that line, the danger of taking all our own plans and
desires for the Divinely appointed path for us. But most
men will by natural humility be saved from that presumption;
and the glad assurance that they are wrapped about
with the love of God is perhaps the greatest need of God's
people in their many sceptical and unspiritual hours.</p>

<p>We cannot, therefore, be surprised that, in connection
with debts and pledges for payment, the same kindness in
the Divine commands should be observable. As usury
was forbidden in Israel, and precautions against excessive
indebtedness were exceedingly elaborate, the possibilities
of oppression in connection with debt in Israel were much
more limited than in most ancient communities. Nevertheless
there was here a region of life in which great
wrongs could still be done by a harsh and unscrupulous
creditor. In order that the creditor might have some
security for what he had lent, it was permitted to receive
and give pledges. The precepts regarding these are contained
in chap, xxiv., vv. 6, 10 ff. and 17, and express a
considerate brotherly spirit, for which it would be hard
to find a parallel either in ancient or modern times. The
creditor who has taken a poor man's upper garment as
a pledge is commanded, both in the Book of the Covenant
and in Deuteronomy, to restore the garment to its owner
in the evening, that he may sleep in it. In Palestine for
much of the year the nights are cold enough, and the
poor man has no covering save his ordinary clothes.
To deprive him of these, therefore, is to inflict punishment
upon him, whereas all that should be aimed at is
the creditor's security. This was peculiarly offensive to
Israelite feeling, as we see from the mention in Amos ii. 8<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
of the breach of this prescription as one of the sins for
which Yahweh would not turn away Israel's punishment.
Further, in no case was a widow's garment to be taken
in pledge, nor the handmill used for preparing the daily
flour, for that is taking "life" in pledge, as the
Deuteronomist says with the feeling for the conditions of
the poor man's life which he always shows.</p>

<p>But the crown of all this kindness is found in the
beautiful tenth verse: "When thou dost lend thy neighbour
any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to
fetch his pledge thou shalt stand without, and the man to
whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without
unto thee." Not only does Yahweh care for external and
physical pain, He sympathises with those deeper wrongs
and pains which may hurt a man's feelings. If a pledge
to satisfy the lender had to be given, scruples of delicacy on
the part of the borrower would appear to the "practical"
man, as he would call himself, contemptibly misplaced.
If the man's feelings were so very superfine, why did he
borrow? But the author of Deuteronomy knew the heart
of God better. With the fine tact of a man of God, he
knew how even the well-meaning rich man's amused
contempt for the poor man's few household treasures,
would cut like a whip, and he knew that Yahweh, who
was "very pitiful and of tender mercy," would desire no
son of Israel to be exposed to it. He knew, too, how
human greed might dispose the lender to seize upon the
thing of greatest value in the poor house, whether its
price was in excess of the loan or not. Finally, he knew
how it deteriorates the poor to be dealt with in an unceremonious,
tactless way even by the benevolent. And
in the name and with the authority of God he forbids it.
The poor man's home, the home of the man whom we
desire to help especially, is to be sacred. In our dealing
with him of all men the finest courtesy is to be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
into play. Just because he needs our help, we are to
stand on points of ceremony with him, which we might
dispense with in dealing with friends and equals. "Thou
shalt stand without," unless he asks thee to enter; and
thou shalt show thereby, in a deeper way than any gifts
or loans can show, that the fraternal tie is acknowledged
and reverenced.</p>

<p>In two other precepts the same delicate regard for the
finer feelings finds expression. In the fifth verse it is
commanded that "When a man taketh a new wife, he shall
not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with
any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall
cheer his wife that he hath taken." The strangeness and
loneliness which everywhere make themselves felt as a
formidable drawback to a young wife's joy, and which in
a polygamous family, where jealousies are bitter, must
often have reached the point of being intolerable, are
provided for. In chap. xxv. 1-3 again, which deals with
the punishment of criminals by beating, it is provided that in
no case shall the number of blows exceed forty, and that
they shall be given in the presence of the judge. This in
itself was a measure of humanity, but the reason given for
the direction is greatly more humane. "Forty stripes he
may give him," says ver. 3; "he shall not exceed; lest, if
he should exceed, and beat him above these with many
stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee."
Even in the case of the criminal care is to be taken that
he be not made an object of contempt. Punishment
has gone beyond its true aim when it makes a man seem
vile unto his neighbours by attacking his dignity as a man;
for that should be inalienable even in a criminal. A man
may have all his material wants satisfied, and yet be
sorely vexed and injured. God sympathises with these
hurts of the soul, and defends His people against them.</p>

<p>After the lovingkindness of these commands, it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
almost needless to say that the smaller social wrongs
which men may inflict upon each other are sternly forbidden.
Often, the rich from want of thought about the
life of the poor carelessly do them wrong. Such a case is
that dealt within chap. xxiv. 14 f.: "Thou shalt not
oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether
he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers (<i>gerim</i>) that
are in thy land within thy gates: in his day thou shalt
give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it;
for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry
against thee unto Yahweh, and it be sin unto thee."
The same command is given in Lev. xix. 13, and
Dillmann is probably right in regarding this as a Deuteronomic
repetition of that, since there the precept forms
part of a pentade of commands dealing with similar things,
while here it stands alone. From early times, therefore,
Yahweh had revealed Himself as considering the poor and
the necessities of their position. Further, the poor man
or the wayfarer was permitted to satisfy his hunger by
taking fruit or grain in his hands as he passed through
the fields. No one was to die of starvation if the fields
were "yielding meat." Last of all, estrangement between
brethren, <i>i.e.</i> all Israelites, was not to free them from duties
of neighbourly love. If a man find a stray ox or sheep or
ass, or a garment or any other lost thing, he is not to
leave it where he finds it. He is to restore it to the
owner; and if the owner is unknown or too far off, the
finder is to keep that which he has found till it is inquired
after. Then if he see his brother's, <i>i.e.</i> his neighbour's, ass
or ox fallen by the way, he must not pass by, but must
help the owner to set it on its feet again. That an
estranged "brother" was especially in view is shown by
the fact that in the parallel passage (Exod. xxiii. 4)
"thine enemy's ox" and "the ass of him that hateth
thee" are mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, we have called these precepts and provisions the
flower and blossom of the Deuteronomic legislation,
because they reveal in their greatest perfection that
sympathy with the commonest and the innermost cares
of men which is the moving impulse of it all. But they
reveal more than that. They show that already in those
far-off days the secret of God's love to man had been
made known. Its universality so far as Israel was
concerned, its penetrative sympathy, its quality of regarding
no human interest as outside its scope, its superhuman
impartiality&mdash;all are here. They are not of course present
in their full sweep and power, as Christ made them known.
Outside of Israel there were the Gentiles, who had a share
only in the "uncovenanted mercies" of God; and even
among the chosen people there were the slaves and the
strangers, who had a comparatively insecure relation to
Him. Further, the thought of the self-sacrifice of God,
though soon to have its dawning in the later chapters of
Isaiah, was not as yet an appreciable element in the
Israelite theology. Nevertheless the passages we have
been considering throw a light upon social duty, as seen
by this inspired servant of God, which puts to shame the
state of the Christian mind on these subjects even now.</p>

<p>The great principles underlying right relations between
men of different social status are, according to these
precepts, courtesy and consideration. Now it is precisely
the want of these which lies at the root of the bitterness
which is so alarming a symptom of our social state at
present. There is not, we are willing to believe, much of
intentional, deliberate oppression exercised by the strong
upon the weak. The injustice that is done is probably
inherent in the present social system, for the character of
which no one living is responsible. But one reason why
reform comes so slowly, and why patience till it can come
dies out among the masses of men, is that the employing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
classes, and those who have inherited privileges, often
convey to those they employ the impression that they are
beyond the pale of the courtesies which are recognised as
binding between men of the same class. Often without
intending it, their manner when they are approached by
those they employ, their short and half-aggrieved replies,
reveal to the latter that they are regarded much more as
parts of the machinery, than as men who might naturally
be expected to claim, and who have a right to, the
recognition of their rights as men.</p>

<p>Of course there are excuses. There is the long tradition
of subordination to arbitrary power, from which none
in earlier ages of the world have been free. There is
the impatience with which a governing and organising
mind listens to grievances which it sees either to be
inevitable under the circumstances, or to be compensated
by some corresponding privilege, which stands or falls
with the thing complained of. And then there is the
absence of outlook, which is the foible of the directing
mind. It is set to rule and make successful a large and
intricate business under given circumstances. The more
effective such a mind is for practical purposes, the more
thoroughly will it limit itself to working out the problem
committed to it. When grievances have to be dealt with
which have their root in the present circumstances, and
which imply changes more or less radical in his fixed
point if they are to be redressed, it is hard for the
employer to persuade himself that his employees are not
merely crying for the moon. If he think so, he will
probably say so; and working men go away from such
interviews with the feeling that it is vain to expect from
employers any sympathy for their aspirations towards a
better social state, which yet they cannot give up without
a slur upon their manhood.</p>

<p>But though these are excuses for the attitude we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
been describing, there can be no question that the fine
and delicate courtesy which Deuteronomy prescribes is
indispensable in order to avert class hostility. Courtesy
cannot, of course, change our social state, and where it
works badly evils that produce friction will remain. But
the first condition of a successful solution of our difficulties
is, that evil tempers should as far as possible be banished,
and for that purpose courtesy even under provocation is
the one sovereign remedy. For it means that you convey
to your neighbour that you consider him in all essentials
your equal. It means, too, that you are willing to recognise
his rights and to respect them. Though power may
be on your side, and weakness on his, that will only make
it more incumbent upon you to show that mere external
circumstances cannot impair your reverence for him as
man. If that be sincerely felt, it opens a way, otherwise
absolutely closed, to mutual confidence and mutual understanding.
These once established, light on all parts of
the social problem (which, be it remembered, employers
and employed must solve together if it is to be solved
at all) will break in upon the minds of both classes. In
spite of the diversity of their immediate interests, the
ultimate interest of all is the same. If contempt and
suspicion were excluded, eyes which are now holden would
be opened, and a common effort to reach a social state
in which all men shall have the opportunity of living lives
worthy of men would become possible. If all would learn
to treat those of other classes with the courtesy which
they constantly show to those of their own, a great step
in the right direction would be taken. Men overlook
much and forgive much to their fellows when these
recognise their equality, and show that they attach importance
to having good relations with them.</p>

<p>But much more is to be aimed at than that. The
esteem for man as man has great conquests yet to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
before even the Deuteronomic courtesy becomes common.
But if these nobler manners are to come in, then the
motives suggested by Deuteronomy will have to be made
effective for our day. What these were it is not difficult
to see. They all had their source in the author's own
relations and the relations of his people to God. Each
of his brethren of the chosen people was a friend of
Yahweh. There was no difference between Israelite men
before Him. He had brought them all, the poor and the
weak, as well as the rich and the strong, out of the
house of bondage; He had guided them all through
the wilderness, and had appointed each household a place
in His land where full communion with Him was to
be had. He had thought many thoughts about them,
had given them laws and statutes dictated by loving insight,
so as to fill their life with the consciousness that
Yahweh loved them, condescended to them, and even
allowed Himself to be made to serve by their sins.
Whatever else they might be, they were friends of God,
and had a right to respect on that ground. And for us
who are Christians all these motives have been intensified
and raised to a higher power. It is not lawful for
us to call any man common or unclean. It is not lawful
to overwhelm and bear down the minds of others by
sheer energy and power. Those "for whom Christ died"
are not to be dealt with save on the worthy plane of
moral and spiritual conviction. That is the law of Christ;
and so long as it is broken in our labour troubles by contemptuous
refusal of conference when it can be granted
without compromising principle, or by slighting references
to labour leaders and a refusal to meet them, when
leaders of another class would be courteously met, so
long will the bitterness which inevitably springs up
trouble us.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be supposed that only the rich can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
sin in this respect. The labour organisations are becoming
in many places, the stronger,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and so far they
have learned the law of courtesy no better than their
opponents. Opprobrious epithets and injurious suspicions
and accusations are the stock-in-trade of some who lead
the labour cause. That is as unworthy in them as it
would be in others; it is not only a crime, but a blunder.</p>

<p>But the practice of courtesy does not end with itself.
It opens the way for that consideration of the circumstances
of the poor which we have found so conspicuous
in Deuteronomy. As we have seen, Yahweh's precepts
contemplate with the nicest care the unavoidable necessities
of the poor man's life. So He stirs us to endeavour
to realise the conditions of our poorer brethren, and by
doing so to avoid the blunders which well-meaning
people make by assuming that the conditions of their own
life are the norm. There are vast varieties of circumstance
in the world; and from lack of consideration those more
favourably situated excite envies and hatreds the bitterness
of which they cannot conceive, by simply taking it for
granted that every one has the same opportunities for
recreation, the same possibilities of rest. To realise clearly
what life and death mean to the toiling millions of men;
to see that matters which are small to those who live the
materially larger and freer life of the class above them are
of vital moment to the poor; to consider and allow for all
such things in their dealings with them,&mdash;this is the
teaching of Deuteronomy. Hence the command to pay
the labourer his wages in the same day. The heart of
man responds when this note is struck. In nothing is the
story of Gautama the Buddha more true to the best instincts
of humanity than in this, that it represents him as
making his great renunciation through coming into intimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
contact with the pain and misery of ordinary life.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> That
gave him insight, and insight wrought sympathy, and
sympathy transformed him from being a petty prince of
Northern India into the consoler and helper of millions
in all Eastern lands. Even hopeless pessimism, when
born of sympathy, has an immense consoling power.
Much more should the inextinguishable hope given by
Christ, combined as it is with the same sympathetic
insight, console men and uplift them.</p>

<p>But the sixteenth verse of chap. xxiii. reminds us that in
that ancient Deuteronomic world there were sad limitations
to these lofty sympathies and hopes. If intensively Deuteronomy
almost reaches the Gospel, extensively it shows the
whole difference between Judaism at its best and Christianity.
Below the world of free-born members of the
Israelite community, to whom the precepts we have hitherto
been considering alone apply, there was the class of slaves,
who in many respects lay beyond the region of the finer
charities. The origin of slavery we need not discuss. It
was a quite universal feature in all ancient communities,
and was doubtless a step upwards from the custom of
destroying all prisoners taken in war. Among the
Hebrews it had always been customary; but in historic
times it was not among them the all-important matter it was
in Greek and Roman polity. Had it been so, it would
have been impossible to discuss the economic ideals of
Israel without taking this social feature into consideration
first. But slaves were comparatively few in Israel, and
the slave trade can never have been extensive, since no
slave markets are mentioned in the Old Testament.
Moreover the social state of the country made owners of
slaves share in the slaves' work, and that of itself prevented
the growth of the worst abuses. But the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
powerful element in making the lot of the slave tolerable
was undoubtedly the just and pitiful character of the
Israelite religion.</p>

<p>The fundamental position with regard to him was,
however, the common one: he was the property of his
master. He could be sold, pledged, given away as a
present, and inherited, and could even be sold to
foreigners. But a female slave, if taken as a subordinate
wife, could not be sold, but only freed if she ceased to
occupy that position. Exclusive of the Canaanites, subject
to forced labour, and the Nethinim, the servants of the
Sanctuary, who occupied much the same place as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">servi publici</i> in Rome, there were two classes of slaves,
non-Israelites and Israelites. The ways in which a
non-Israelite slave could come into Israelite hands were
just what they were elsewhere. They might be prisoners
of war, they might be purchased from travelling merchants,
they might voluntarily have sold themselves from poverty
in a strange land, or might have been sold for debt,
and finally they might be children born of slaves. Their
lot was of course the hardest. Yet even they were not
so entirely unprotected by the law as slaves were
among Greeks and Romans. They were recognised as
men, having certain general human rights. The master
had no right to kill; and if he maimed his slave he had
to give him his freedom, according to the oldest law (Exod.
xvi. 20 f.). The law regarding the killing of a slave has
often been quoted as singularly harsh, especially that
clause which says that if a slave when fatally smitten lives
for some days after the blow, his death shall not be
avenged, "for he is his (the master's) money." But it
ought, notwithstanding the harshness of the expression,
to be judged quite otherwise. The fact that death was
not immediate was taken to indicate that death was not
intended, and consequently the loss of the slave was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
thought a sufficient punishment. But the prohibition of
the deliberate murder of a slave was a humane provision
which could not be paralleled in the Gr√¶co-Roman world.
Moreover these laws would not seem to have been widely
called into action. The humane spirit became so general
in Israel that slaves were generally well treated. In
Prov. xxix. 21 over-indulgence to a slave is deprecated,
as if it were a common error; and during the whole
history there is no mention of evils resulting from cruel
treatment of slaves, much less any record of servile insurrection.
Nor is there very frequent mention even of
runaway slaves. On the other hand, we read of slaves
who were stewards of their masters' houses; others
probably were entrusted with the charge of the education
of children.</p>

<p>In Deuteronomy we find, as we should expect, that the
movement towards humanity in dealing with slaves is
greatly furthered. In chap. xxi. 10 ff. the hardship of
a woman's lot when she was taken captive in war is
mitigated with sympathetic insight. To modern women of
the Western world the lot of such an one seems so dreadful
that no mitigation of it can make any difference. The
current teaching among even religious men is that rather
than submit to it a woman is justified in suicide. But
in antiquity the personality of woman was undeveloped,
the chances of life constantly passed her from one master
to another, and things intolerable now were tolerable then.
Making even these allowances, however, if we look at
the law of the Old Testament as being in all its provisions
and <i>ab initio</i> Divine, it seems impossible to praise it. A
law which graciously permitted a captive woman to
mourn for her people for a month, and only then allowed
her captor to marry her, but if he wished afterwards to
get rid of her provided that he should not sell her, but
should let her go whither she would, cannot be said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
in itself compassionate. But, if the customary law of the
Israelite tribes, restrained and purified by the higher
spirit, be regarded as the basis of Old Testament legislation,
then the leaven of religion and humanity can be
seen working nobly, and in a manner worthy of revelation,
even in such cases as these. Long after the Christian
era we see what the ordinary fate of a captive woman
was, in the conduct of Khalid the "sword of the Lord,"
one of the first great Mohammedan soldiers. When he
had captured Malik ibn Noweira, who had resisted Islam,
along with his wife, he gave orders which led to Malik's
death, and the same night he married his widow.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Shortly
afterwards, at the battle of Yemama, he demanded the
daughter of his captive Mojda, and married her, as the
Caliph wrote in reproof, "whilst the ground beneath the
nuptial couch was yet moistened with the blood of twelve
hundred." Horrors like these Deuteronomy forbids. The
frenzied moments of a captive's first grief are respected,
and some tenderness is shown to woman in a world where
her lot at its best had always in it possibilities which
cannot now be even thought of with equanimity. The
same steady pressure to a nobler form of life is likewise
seen in the Deuteronomic law dealing with the case of
a foreign slave who had taken refuge in Israel (Deut.
xxiii. 15 f.). In the words, "Thou shalt not deliver unto
his master the slave which is escaped from his master
unto thee; he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee,
in the place which he shall choose within one of thy
gates, where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress
him," we have, thus early, the same legislation which it is
the peculiar boast of England to have introduced into the
modern world. "Slaves cannot breathe in England," and
the moment they touch British soil in any part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
world they are free. This was the case with the land of
Israel according to the Deuteronomic conception of what
it ought to be.</p>

<p>But the highest points of privilege come to the non-Israelite
slave in a way which disturbs the modern
conscience, for they came by means of compulsion in
religion. In contrast to the day labourer and the
"Toshab" or sojourner, the slave <em>must</em> be of his master's
religion. For a heathen, however, that was not a difficulty.
His gods were gods of his land; and when he left his
land and was carried into a foreign country, he had no
scruple about worshipping the god of the new land. A
typical case of this is found in the narrative 2 Kings xvii.,
where the immigrants whom the king of Assyria had
settled in Samaria after Israel had been carried captive
besought him to send some one to teach them how to
worship Yahweh. This adoption of the master's religion
secured equality of slave and free to a degree which
could not otherwise have been attained, and brought the
slaves fully within the humanity of the Hebrew law.
It gave them the Sabbath (chap. v. 14). It gave a full
share in all the religious festivals and a part in the
sacrificial feasts (Deut. xii. 12 and xvi. 11, 14). Such
slaves were, in fact, fully adopted into the family of God,
and became brethren, poorer and more unfortunate, but
still brethren of their masters. They had indeed no claim
to freedom, as Israelite slaves had; they were slaves in
perpetuity. But their slavery was of a kind that did not
degrade them beneath the condition of man.</p>

<p>With regard to Israelite slaves the beneficence of the
law was naturally still greater. The fullest statement in
regard to them is found, not in Deuteronomy, but in
Lev. xxv. 39-46; but in the main we may suppose that
in its larger outlines the distinction between Israelite
and non-Israelite slaves there insisted on was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
acknowledged. They were not to be thrust down into
the lowest depth of slavery, and they were not to be set
to the lowest kinds of labour, rather to that which hired
labourers were wont to do, because they were of the
children of Israel, of the nation whom Yahweh had
brought out of the house of bondage. Further, they had
a right to emancipation every seventh year, that is to say,
whenever they had served six full years they could claim
freedom in the seventh. Their original property was
meant to be restored to them in the Sabbatic year, and so
their degradation could last only for a very limited time.
In Exod. xxi. 2 ff. we find the original provisions concerning
the Israelite slave. Deuteronomy simply took
these up, and modified them in certain respects. It
extends all that Exodus says of the slave to the female
slave also, and, in its care for and understanding of the
difficulties of the poor, enacts that a slave when set free
shall receive a fresh start in life from the cattle, the
barn, and the winepress of the former owner. But this
anticipation of discharged prisoners' aid societies was too
high a demand upon a faithless generation. Even
Jeremiah could not get it carried out; and the probability
is that none but the most spiritually minded of the Jews
ever regarded it as binding law.</p>

<p>The love which love of Yahweh inspired spread still
more widely. It took in not only the poor and the slave,
but it took account also of the lower animals. It has been
often made a reproach to Christianity that it makes no
such appeal on behalf of the lower creation as Buddhism
does. But that reproach (like the kindred one brought
by J. S. Mill, that in comparison with the Qur'an the
New Testament is defective in not pressing civil duty) is
tenable only if the New Testament be absolutely severed
from the Old. Taken as the completion of the moral
and religious development begun in Israel, Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
takes up into itself all the experience, and all the teaching
by example, which the Old Testament contains. It
does not repeat it, because to the first Christians the
Old Testament was the Divinely inspired guide. It was
at first their whole Bible, and to take the New Testament
by itself as an independent product is to mutilate
both the Old and the New. When the Old Testament,
therefore, enjoins kindness to animals we may set down
all that it prescribes to the credit of Christianity. So
much, at least, the latter must be held to teach; and if we
consider the spirit as well as the letter of this law, there
is no exaggeration in saying that it covers all the ground.
Here, as in the case of slaves and the poor, the fundamental
reason for kindness is relation to God. In the
Yahwist's narrative in Gen. ii. all creatures are formed by
God, and God Himself shows kindness to them. Indeed
in passages like Psalm xxxvi. 7, as Cheyne well remarks,
there is an implication "that morally speaking there is
no complete break of continuity in the scale of sentient
life," and that, as is seen by passages like Jer. xxi. 6,
and Isa. iv. 11, the mild domesticated animals "are in
fact regarded as a part of the human community." In
the Decalogue the animals that labour with and for man
have their share in the Sabbath rest, and the produce of
the fields during the Sabbatic year (Exod. xxiii. 11; Lev.
xxv. 7) is to be for them as well as for the poor. That they
were mere machines of flesh and blood, to be driven till
they were worn out, and were then to be cast aside, seems
never to have occurred to the Israelite mind. These
helpful creatures had made a covenant with man, and
had a share in the consideration which the sons of Israel
were taught to have for one another. In reaching that
attainment Israel had reached the only effective ground
for dealing with animals, as Cheyne says, "without
inhumanity and without sentimentalism." The individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
prescriptions of Deuteronomy emphasise and bring down
these principles into the practical life. It is probable that
the precept not to seethe a kid in its mother's milk
(Deut. xiv. 21) was, in part at least, a law of kindness,
founded upon a reverential feeling for the parental
relationship even in this lower sphere. The command in
Deut. xxii. 6 is certainly so. We read there: "If a bird's
nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on
the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting
upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the
dam with the young; thou shalt in any wise let the dam
go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that
it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong
thy days." Evidently the ground of sympathy here is
the existence and the sacredness of the parental relationship.
The mother bird is sacred as a mother; and length
of days is promised to those who regard the sanctity
of motherhood in this sphere, as it is promised to those
who observe the fifth commandment of the Decalogue.
Thus intimately the lower creation is drawn into the human
sphere.</p>

<p>The only other precepts under this head are that a
fallen animal is always to be lifted (Deut. xxii. 4), and
the ox is not to be muzzled when it is treading out the
corn (Deut. xxv. 4). These were ordinary prescriptions
of humanity, but they too rest upon the sympathetic
identification of the sufferings and wants of all sentient
beings with those of mankind. It may be objected,
however, that St. Paul denies that the last precept
really was due to pity for the oxen. In 1 Cor. ix. 9,
referring to it, he says, "Is it for the oxen that God careth,
or saith He it altogether for our sake? Yea, for our sake
it was written." But there is no real contradiction here.
It is quite impossible that a devout Jew like St. Paul did
not believe that God's "tender mercies are over all His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
works" (Psalm cxlv. 9). He would have been false to all
his training had he not accepted that as a fundamental
axiom. His apparent denial does not refer at all to the
historic fact that the precept <em>was</em> given because of God's
care for oxen. It only signifies that, when taken in its
highest sense, it was meant to form character in <em>men</em>.
St. Paul argues, as Alford says, "that not the oxen, but
those for whom the law was given, were its objects.
Every duty of <em>humanity</em> has for its ultimate ground, not
the mere welfare of the animal concerned, but its welfare in
that system of which man is the head, and therefore man's
welfare." In fact St. Paul understood the Old Testament
as we have seen it demands to be understood, and places
the duty of kindness to animals in its right relation to man.</p>

<p>In all relations, therefore, Deuteronomy insists that life's
main principle shall be love illumined by sympathy.
Beginning with God and giving man's unquiet heart a firm
anchorage there, it commands that all creatures about us
shall be embraced in the same sympathising tenderness.
It forbids us to look upon any of them as mere instruments
for our use, for all of them have ends of their own in the
loving thought of God. God is for it the great unifying,
harmonising power in the world, and from a right conception
of Him all right living flows. If the New Testament
asks with wonder how a man who loves not his brother
whom he hath seen can love God whom he hath not seen,
the Old Testament teaches with equal emphasis the
complementary truth that he who loves not God whom he
hath not seen will never love as he ought his brother
whom he hath seen. For to it Yahweh is the first and
last word; and all the growth in kindness, gentleness,
consideration, and goodness which can be traced in the
revelation given to Israel, has its source in a conception
of the Divine character which from the first was spiritual,
and was moreover unique in the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3><i>MOSES' FAREWELL SPEECHES</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deut.</span> iv. 1-40, xxvii.-xxx.</h4>


<p>With the twenty-sixth chapter the entirely homogeneous
central portion of the Book of Deuteronomy
ends, and it concludes it most worthily. It prescribes two
ceremonies which are meant to give solemn expression
to the feeling of thankfulness which the love of God,
manifested in so many laws and precepts, covering the
commonest details of life, should have made the predominant
feeling. The first is the utterance of what we
have called the "liturgy of gratitude" at the time of the
feast of firstfruits; and the second is the solemn dedication
of the third year's tithe to the poor and the fatherless, and
the disclaimer of any misuse of it. Further notice of
either after what has already been said in reference to
them would be superfluous. The closing verses (16-19)
of the chapter are a solemn reminder that all these
transactions with God had bound the people to Yahweh in
a covenant. "Thou hast avouched Yahweh this day to be
thy God" and, "Yahweh hath avouched thee this day to
be a peculiar people ('<i>am seg≈´llƒÅh</i>) unto Himself." By this
they were bound to keep Yahweh's statutes and judgments,
and do them with all their heart and with all their soul,
while He, on His part, undertakes on these terms to set
them "high above all nations which He hath made in
praise, and in name, and in honour," and to make them a
holy people unto Himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>But the original Deuteronomy as read to King Josiah
cannot have ended with chapter xxvi., for the thing that
awed him most was the threat of evil and desolation
which were to follow the non-observance of this covenant.
Now though there are indications of such dangers in the
first twenty-six chapters of Deuteronomy, yet threats are
not, so far, a prominent part of this book. The book as
read must consequently have contained some additional
chapters, which, in part at least, must have contained
threats. Now this is what we have in our Biblical Deuteronomy.
But in chapters xxvii. and xxviii. there are
reduplications which can hardly have formed part of the
original author's work. An examination of these has led
every one who admits composite authorship in the Pentateuch
to see that from chapter xxvii. onwards the original
work has been broken up and dovetailed again with the
works of JE and P; so that component parts of the first
four books of the Hexateuch appear along with elements
which the author of Deuteronomy has supplied. We
have, in fact, before us, from this point, the work of the
editor who fitted Deuteronomy into the framework of the
Pentateuch; and it is of importance, from an expository
point of view even, to endeavour to restore Deuteronomy
to its original form, and to follow out the traces of it that
are left.</p>

<p>As we have said, we must look for the threats and
promises which undoubtedly formed part of it. These
are contained in chapters xxvii. and xxviii. But a careful
reader will feel at once that chapter xxvii. disturbs
the connection, and that xxviii. should follow xxvi. In
chapter xxvii., vv. 9 and 10 alone seem necessary to
give a transition to chapter xxviii.; and if all the rest
were omitted we should have exactly what the narrative
in Kings would lead us to expect, a coherent, natural
sequence of blessings and curses, which should follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
faithfulness to the covenant, or unfaithfulness. The
rest of chapter xxvii. is not consistent either with itself
or with Josh. viii. 30, where the accomplishment of that
which is commanded here is recorded. In vv. 1-3 Moses
and the elders command the people to set up great stones
and plaister them with plaister and write upon them all
the words of this law, on the day when they shall pass
over Jordan, that they may go in unto the land. In ver. 4
it is said that these stones are to be set up in Mount
Ebal, and there an altar of unhewn stones is to be built,
and sacrifices offered, "and thou shalt write upon the
stones very plainly." From the position of this last
clause and the mention of Mount Ebal, the course of
events would be quite different from that which vv. 1-3
suggest. The stones were, according to the verses 4 ff.,
to be set up in Mount Ebal; out of these an altar of
unhewn stones was to be built; and on them the law
was to be inscribed, and this is what Joshua says was
done. But if we take all the verses, 1-8, together, we can
reconcile them only by the hypothesis that the stones were
set up as soon as Jordan was crossed, plaistered, and
inscribed with the law; that afterwards they were removed
to Mount Ebal and built into an altar "of unhewn stone,"
upon which sacrifices were offered. But that surely is
in the highest degree improbable; and since we know
that in other cases two narratives have been combined
in the sacred text, that would seem the most probable
solution here. Verses 4-8 will in that case be a later
insertion, probably from J. In the same connection
vv. 15-26 contain a list of crimes which are visited with
a curse and no blessings; this cannot be the proclamation
of blessing and cursing which is here required. Further,
this list must be by a different author, for it affixes curses
to some crimes which are not mentioned in Deuteronomy,
and omits such sins as idolatry, which are continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
mentioned there. This section must consequently have
been inserted here by some later hand. It must probably
have been later even than the time of the writer of
Josh. viii. 33 ff., since the arrangement as reported there
differs from what is prescribed here. Moreover, as there
is nothing new in these sections, and all they say is
repeated substantially in chapter xxviii., we may give our
attention wholly to chapter xxviii. 1-68, as being the
original proclamation of blessing and curse.</p>

<p>But other entanglements follow. Chapters xxix. and
xxx. manifestly contained an adieu on the part of Moses,
who turns finally to the people with an affecting and
solemn speech of farewell. That appears in chapters
xxix. and xxx. But for many reasons it is impossible
to believe that these chapters as they stand are the
original speech of Deuteronomy.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The language is in
large part different, and there are references to the
Book of the Law as being already written out (chap.
xxix. 19 f. 26, and chap. xxx. 10). It is probably therefore
an editor's rewriting of the original speech, and from
the fact that "it contains many points of contact with
Jeremiah in thoughts and words," it is probably to be
dated in the Exile. But there is another noticeable thing
in connection with it. It has a remarkable resemblance in
these and other respects to chapter iv. 1-40. That passage
can hardly have originally followed chapters i.-iii., if as
is most probable these were at first an historic introduction
to Deuteronomy. The hortative character of
iv. 1-40 shows that it must have been placed where it
is by a reviser. But the language, though not altogether
that of Deuteronomy, is like it, and the thought is also
Deuteronomic. Probably the passage must have been
transferred from some other part of Deuteronomy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
adapted by the editor. A clue to its true place may
perhaps be found in ver. 8, where "all this law" is spoken
of as if it were already given, and in ver. 5, where we
read, "Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments."
These passages imply that the law of Deuteronomy had
been given, and in that case chapter iv. must belong to
a closing speech. We probably shall not be in error,
therefore, in thinking that chapters iv. 1-40 and xxix. and
xxx. are all founded on an original farewell speech which
stood in Deuteronomy after the blessing and the curse.</p>

<p>But it may be asked, if that be so, why did an editor
make these changes? The answer is to be found in two
passages in chapters xxxi. and xxxii. which cannot
be harmonised as they stand. In xxxi. 19 we are told
that Yahweh commanded Moses to write "this song" and
teach it to the children of Israel, "that this song may be a
witness for Me against the children of Israel," and ver. 22,
"So Moses wrote this song." But in vv. 28 f. we read
that "Moses said, Assemble unto me all the elders
of the tribes and your officers, that I may speak these
words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to
witness against them." Obviously "these words" are
different from "this song," and are meant for a different
purpose. The same ambiguity occurs at the end of the
song in vv. 44 ff., where we first read of Moses ending
"this song," and in the next verse we read, "And Moses
made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel."
Now what has become of "<em>these words</em>"? In all probability
they were the substance of chapters iv. and xxix. and xxx.,
and were separated and amplified, because the editor who
fitted Deuteronomy into the Pentateuch took over the
song in chapter xxxii., as well as those passages of xxxi.
and xxxii. that speak of this song, from JE. He accepted
them as a fitting conclusion for the career of Moses,
and transferred the original speech, which we suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to have been the last great utterance of the original
Deuteronomy, putting the main part of it immediately
before the song, but taking parts out of it to form a
hortatory ending (such as the other Moses' speeches
have) to that first one which he had formed out of the
historic introduction. This may seem a very complicated
process and an unlikely one; but after the foundation had
been built by Dillmann, Westphal has elaborated the
whole matter with such luminous force that it seems
hardly possible to doubt that the facts can be accounted
for only in this way. By piecing together iv., xxx., and
xxxi. he produces a speech so thoroughly coherent and
consistent that the mere reading of it becomes the most
cogent proof of the substantial truth of his argument.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>An analysis of it will show this, (1) There is the
introduction; up till now the people have understood
neither the commands nor the love of Yahweh (xxix. 1-9).
(2) There is the explanation of the Covenant (xxix. 10-15);
(3) A command to observe the Covenant (iv. 1, 2); (4)
Warning against individual transgression, which will be
punished by the destruction of the rebel (xxix. 16-21, iv.
3, 4); (5) Warning against collective transgression, which
will be punished by the ruin of the people (iv. 5-26).
The author, from this point regarding the transgression as
an accomplished fact, announces: (6) The dispersion and
exile of the people (iv. 27, 28); (7) The impression produced
on future generations by the horror of this dispersion
(xxix. 22-28); (8) The conversion of the exiles to
God (iv. 30, 31); (9) Their return to the land of their
fathers xxx. (1-10). (10) In conclusion, it is stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
the power of Yahweh to sustain the faith of His people
and to save them is guaranteed by the past (iv. 32-40);
and there is no reason therefore that the people should
shrink from obeying the commandment prescribed to
them. It is a matter of will. Life and death are before
them; let them choose (xxx. 11-20).</p>

<p>The analysis of the remaining chapters is not difficult.
Chapter xxxi., vv. 14-23 and 30, form the introduction
to the song, chapter xxxii., vv. 1-43, just as ver. 44 is the
conclusion of it. Both introduction and song are extracted
probably from J and E. Verses 48-52 are after P. Then
follows the blessing of Moses, chapter xxxiii. Finally,
chapter xxxiv. contains an account of Moses' death and a
final eulogy of him, in which all the sources JE, P, and D
have been called into requisition. The threefold cord
which runs through the other books of the Pentateuch
was untwisted to receive Deuteronomy, and has been re-twisted
so as to bind the Pentateuch into one coherent
whole. That is the result of the microscopic examination
which the text as it stands has undergone, and we may
pretty certainly accept it as correct. But we should not
lose sight of the fact that, as the book is now arranged,
it has a notable coherence of its own, and the impression
of unity which it conveys is in itself a result of great
literary skill. Not only has the editor combined Deuteronomy
into the other narratives most successfully, but
he has done so not only without falsifying, but so as
to confirm and enhance the impression which the original
book was meant to convey.</p>

<p>We turn now to the substance of the two speeches&mdash;the
proclamation of the blessing and the curse, and the great
farewell address. As we have seen, the first is contained
in chapter xxviii. If any evidence were now needed that
this chapter was written later than the Mosaic time, it
might be found in the space given to the curses, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
much heavier emphasis laid upon them than upon the
blessings. Not that Moses might not have prophetically
foretold Israel's disregard of warnings. But if the heights
to which Israel was actually to rise had been before
the author's mind as still future, instead of being wrapped
in the mists of the past, he could not but have dwelt
more equally upon both sides of the picture. Whatever
supernatural gifts a prophet might have, he was still and
in all things a man. He was subject to moods like
others, and the determination of these depended upon his
surroundings. He was not kept by the power of God
beyond the shadows which the clouds in his sky might
cast; and we may safely say that if the curses which are
to follow disobedience are elaborated and dwelt upon
much more than the blessings which are to reward obedience,
it is because the author lived at a time of unfaithfulness
and revolt. Obviously his contemporaries were
going far in the evil way, and he warns them with intense
and eager earnestness against the dangers they are so
recklessly incurring.</p>

<p>But after all we have seen of the spirituality of the
Deuteronomic teaching, and its insistence upon love as
the true bond between men and God and the true motive
to all right action, it is perhaps disappointing to some to
find how entirely these promises and threats have their
centre in the material world. Probably nowhere else will
the truth of Bacon's famous saying that "Prosperity is
the blessing of the Old Testament" be more conspicuously
seen than here. If Israel be faithful she is promised productivity,
riches, success in war. Even when it is promised
that she shall be established by Yahweh as a holy people
unto Himself, the meaning seems to be that the people
shall be separated from others by these earthly favours,
rather than that they shall have the moral and spiritual
qualities which the word "holy" now connotes. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
nations shall fear Israel because of the Divine favour.
Israel shall be raised above them all. If it become unfaithful,
on the other hand, it is to be visited with pestilence,
consumption, fever, inflammation, sword, blasting,
mildew. The earth is to be iron beneath them, and the
heaven above them brass. Instead of rain they are to have
dust; they are to be visited with more than Egyptian
plagues. Their minds are to refuse to serve them; they
are to be defeated in war; their country is to be overrun by
marauders; their wives and children, their cattle and their
crops, are to fall into the enemy's hands. Locusts and all
known pests are to fall upon their fields; and they themselves
are to be carried away captive, after having endured
the worst horrors of siege, and been compelled by hunger
to devour their own children. And in exile they shall be
an astonishment, a proverb, and a by-word, and shall be
ruled by oppressive aliens. Worst of all, they shall there
lose hope in God and "shall serve other gods, even wood
and stone." Their lives shall hang in doubt before them.
In the morning they shall say, "Would God it were
evening," and at even they shall say, "Would God it
were morning." All the deliverance Yahweh had wrought
for them by bringing them out of Egypt would be undone,
and once more they should go back into Egyptian bondage.</p>

<p>All that is materialistic enough; but there is no need
to make apology for Deuteronomy, nevertheless. The
prophet has taught the higher law; he has rooted all
human duty, both to God and man, in love to God, and
now he tries to enlist man's natural fear and hope as
allies of his highest principle. How justifiable that is
we have already seen in Chapter XII., pp. 231 ff.</p>

<p>But a more serious question is raised when it is asked,
does Nature, in definite sober truth, lend itself, in the
manner implied throughout this chapter, to the support
of religious and moral fidelity? At a time when imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
literature is largely devoting itself to an angry or
querulous denial of any righteous force working for the
unfortunate and the faithful,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> there can be no question
what the popular answer to such a question would be.
But from the ranks of literature itself we may summon
testimony on the other side. Mr. Hall Caine, in his
address at the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution,
maintains in a wider and more general way the essence of
the Deuteronomic thesis when he says, "I count him the
greatest genius who touches the magnetic and Divine
chord in humanity which is always waiting to vibrate to
the sublime hope of recompense; I count him the greatest
man who teaches men that the world is ruled in righteousness."
And his justification of that position is too
admirable not to be quoted: "Life is made up of a
multitude of fragments, a sea of many currents, often
coming into collision and throwing up breakers. We
look around and see wrong-doing victorious, and right-doing
in the dust; the evil man growing rich and dying
in his bed, the good man becoming poor and dying in the
street; and our hearts sink and we say, What is God
doing after all in this world of His children? But our
days are few, our view is limited, we cannot watch the
event long enough to see the end which Providence sees."
"It is the very province of imaginative genius," he goes
on to say, "to see that which the common mind cannot
see, to offer to it at least suggestions of how these
triumphs of unrighteousness may be accounted for in
accordance with the law that righteousness rules in the
world." We would go further. It is one of the main
purposes of inspiration to go beyond even imaginative
genius, to point out in history not only how right may
perhaps ultimately triumph, but how it has been in reality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and must be victorious. For it will not do to shut off the
world of material things from the working of this great
and universal law. Owing to the narrow fanaticism of
science, modern men have become sceptical, not only
of miracle, but even of the fundamental truth that
righteousness is profitable for the life that now is, that in
following righteousness men are co-operating with the
deepest law of the universe. But it remains a truth for
all that. It is written deep in the heart of man; and in
more wavering lines perhaps, but still most legibly, it
is written on the face of things. With the limitations
of his time and place, this is what the Deuteronomist
preaches. Doubtless he has not faced, as Job does, the
whole of the problem; still less has he attained to the
final insight exhibited in the New Testament, that
temporal gifts may be curses in disguise, that the highest
region of recompense is in the eternal life, in the domain
of things which are invisible but eternal. He does not
yet <em>know</em>, though he has perhaps a presentiment of it,
that being completely stripped of all earthly good may be
the path to the highest victory&mdash;the victory which makes
men more than conquerors through Christ. Nevertheless
he is, making these allowances, right, and the moderns
are wrong. In many ways obedience to spiritual inspirations
does bring worldly prosperity. The absence of
moral and spiritual faithfulness does affect even the fruitfulness
of the soil, the fecundity of animals, the prevalence
of disease, the stability of ordered life and success in
war. This was visible to the ancient world generally in
a dim way; but by the inspired men of the Old Covenant
it was clearly seen, for they were enlightened for the very
purpose of seeing the hand of God where others saw it
not. But they never thought of tracing out the chain of
intermediate causes by which such results were connected
with men's spiritual state. They saw the facts, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
recognised the truth, and they threw themselves back at
once upon the will of God as the sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>We, on the other hand, have been so diligent in tracing
out the immediately preceding links of natural causation
that, for the most part, we have been fatigued before we
reached God. We consequently have lost view of Him;
and it is wholesome for us to be brought sharply into
contact with the ancient Oriental mind as we are here,
in order that we may be forced to go the whole way back
to Him. For the fact is that much of that very process
of decay and destruction from moral causes is going on
before us in countries like Turkey and Morocco, where
social righteousness is all but unknown, and private
morality is low. A truly modern mind scorns the idea
that the fertility of the soil can be affected by immorality.
Yet there is the whole of Mesopotamia to show that misgovernment
can make a garden into a desert. Where
teeming populations once covered the country with fruitful
gardens and luxurious cities, there is now in the lands of
the Tigris and Euphrates a few handfuls of people, and all
the fertility of the country has disappeared. Irrigation
channels which made all things live have been choked
up and have been gradually filled with drifting sand,
and one of the most populous and fertile countries of the
world has become a desert. In Palestine the same thing
may be seen. Under Turkish domination the character of
the soil has been entirely changed. In many places where
in ancient days the hills were terraced to the top the
sweeping rains have had their way, and the very soil has
been carried off, leaving only rocks to blister in the
pitiless sun. Even in the less likely sphere of animal
fecundity modern science shows that peace and good
government and righteous order are causes of extraordinary
power. And the movements which are going
on around us at this day in the elevation and depression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
of nations and races have a visible connection with fidelity
or lack of fidelity to known principles of order and justice.
This can be said without concealing how scanty and
partial in most cases such attainments are. Prevailing
principles can be discerned in the providence which rules
the world. And these are of such a kind that the connection
which obedience to the highest known rules of life
has with fertility, success and prosperity, is constant and
intimate. It is, too, far wider reaching than at first sight
would seem possible. To this extent, even modern
knowledge justifies these blessings and curses of
Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>But it may be asked, Is this all the Old Testament
means by such threats and promises? Does it recognise
any even self-imposed limitations to the direct action of
Divine power? Most probably it does not. Though
always keeping clear of Pantheism, the Old Testament
is so filled and possessed by the Divine Presence that
all second causes are ignored, and the action of God
upon nature was conceived, as it could not fail to be, on
the analogy of a workman using tools. Now that the
methods of Divine action in nature have been studied
in the light of science, they have been found to be more
fixed and regular than was supposed. The extent of
their operation, too, has been found to be immeasurably
wider, and the purposes which have to be cared for at
every moment are now seen to be infinitely various. As
a result, human thought has fallen back discouraged,
and takes refuge more and more in a conception of
nature which practically deifies it, or at least entirely
separates it from any intimate relation to the will of
God. It is even denied that there is any purpose in
the world at all, or any goal, and to chance or fate all
the vicissitudes of life and the mechanical changes of
nature are attributed. But though we must recognise, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
the Old Testament does not, that ordinary Divine action
flows out in perfectly well-defined channels, and is so
stable in its movement that results in the sphere of physical
nature may be predicted with certainty; and though we
see, as was not seen in ancient days, that even God does
not always approach His ends by direct and short-cut
paths,&mdash;these considerations only make the Old Testament
view more inspiring and more healthful for us. We may
gather from it the inference that if the fertility of a land,
the frequency of disease, and success in war are so
powerfully affected by the moral and spiritual quality of
a people, it is very likely that in subtler and less palpable
ways the same influences produce similar effects, even
in regions where they cannot be traced. If so, whatever
allowance may be required for the inevitable simplicity
of Old Testament conceptions on this subject, however
much we miss the limitations we have learned to regard
as necessary, the Deuteronomic view as to the effects of
moral and spiritual declension upon the material fortunes
of a people is much nearer the truth than our timorous
and hesitating half-belief. To find these effects emphasised
and affirmed as they are here, therefore, acts as
a much needed tonic in our spiritual life. Coming too
from a man who possessed, if ever man did, Divinely
inspired insight into the process of the world and the
ideal of human life, these promises and warnings bring
God near. They dissipate the mists which obscure the
workings of God's Providence, and keep before us aspects
of truth which it is the present tendency of thought to
ignore too much. They declare in accents which carry
conviction that, even in material things, the Lord reigneth;
and for that the world has reason to be supremely
glad.</p>

<p>Certainly Christians now know that prosperity in
material things is by no means God's best gift. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
great principle must be held to firmly, as well as the
legitimacy of the vivid hopes and fears of Old Testament
times regarding the material rewards of right-doing. In
many ways the new principle must overrule and modify
for us those hopes and fears. But with this limitation
we are justified in occupying the Deuteronomic standpoint
and in repeating the Deuteronomic warnings. For
to its very core the world is God's; and those who find
His working everywhere are those whose eyes have been
opened to the inmost truth of things.</p>

<p>With regard to the farewell speech contained in
chapters xxix. and xxx. and the related parts of chapter iv.
and chapter xxxi. there is not much to be said. Taken
as a whole, it develops the promises and threats of the
previous chapters, and repeats again with affectionate
hortatory purpose much of the history. But there is
not a great deal that is new; most of the underlying
principles of the address have been already dealt with.
Taken according to the reconstruction of the speech
and its reinsertion in its original framework, the course
of things would seem to have been this. After the
threats and promises had been concluded, Moses, carrying
on the injunction of iii. 28, addressed (chapter
xxxii. 8) all the people and appointed Joshua to be his
successor; then he wrote out "this law," and produced
it before the priests and elders of the people, with
the instruction that at the end of every seven years,
at the feast of release, in the feast of tabernacles, it
should be read before all Israel, men, women, and children
(chapter xxxi., w. 9-13). Then he gave the book
to the Levites, that they might "lay it up" by the side
of the Ark of the Covenant of Yahweh their God, that
it might be there for a witness against them when they
became unfaithful, as he foresaw they would. He next
summons all Israel to him, and delivers the farewell address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
contained in chapters iv., xxix., and xxx., an outline of
which has already been given (p. 438), according to Westphal's
recombination. This would seem to indicate that
Moses himself inaugurated the custom of reading the law
and giving instruction to all the people, which he prescribed
for the feast of tabernacles in the year of release.
After the law had been given he addressed the whole
people in this farewell speech.</p>

<p>But though on the whole there is no need for detailed
exposition here, there are one or two things which ought
to be noticed, things which express the spirit of Deuteronomy
so directly and so sincerely that they can be
identified as forming part of the original Deuteronomic
speech. One of these is unquestionably xxx. 11-20. At
the end of the farewell address a return is made to the
core of the whole Deuteronomic teaching: "Thou shalt
love Yahweh thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might." This was announced
with unique emphasis at the beginning; it has lain behind
all the special commands which have been insisted upon
since; and now it emerges again into view as the
conclusion of the whole matter. For beyond doubt this,
and not the whole series of legal precepts, is what is
meant by "this commandment" in verse 11. Both before
it, in the sixth and tenth verses, and after it, in the sixteenth
and twentieth verses, this precept is repeated and insisted
on as the Divine command. Had the individual commands
or the whole mass of them together been meant, the
phrase used would have been different. It would have
been that in ver. 10, where they are called "His commandments
and His statutes which are written in this book of
the law," or something analogous. No, it is the central
command of love to God, without which all external
obedience is vain, which is the theme of this last great
paragraph; and a clear perception of this will carry us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
through both the obscurities of it, and the difficulties of
St. Paul's application of it in the Romans.</p>

<p>Of this then the author of Deuteronomy says: "It is
not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. It is not in
heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to
heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that
we may do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and
bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do
it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth,
and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it." That is to say,
there is no mystery or difficulty about this commandment
of love. Neither have you to go to the uttermost parts
of the sea to hear it, nor need you search into the
mysteries of heaven. It has been brought near to you by
all the mercy and forgiveness and kindness of Yahweh;
it has been made known to you now by my mouth, even
in its pettiest applications. But that is not all; it is
graven on your own heart, which leaps up in glad
response to this demand, and in answer to the manifestation
of God's love for you. It is really the fundamental
principle of your own nature that is appealed to. You
should clearly feel that life in the love of God and man is
the only fit life for you who are made in the image of
God. If you do, then the fulfilment of all the Divine
precepts will be easy, and your lives will lighten more
and more unto the perfect day.</p>

<p>Now, for an Oriental of the pre-Christian era such
teaching is most marvellous. How marvellous it is
Christians perhaps find it difficult to see. In point of
fact, many have denied that Old Testament teaching
ever had this character. Misled by the doctrines of Islam,
the great Semitic religion of to-day, many assert that the
religion of ancient Israel called upon men to submit to
mere power in submitting to God. But the appeal of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
text to the heart of man shows that this is an error. No
such appeal has ever been made to Mohammedans. Their
state of mind in regard to God is represented by the remark
of a recent traveller in Persia. Speaking of the Persian
Babis, who may be described roughly as an heretical
sect whose minds have been formed by Mohammedanism,
he says: "They seemed to have no conception of absolute
good, or absolute truth; to them good was merely what
God chose to ordain, and truth what He chose to reveal,
so that they could not understand how any one could
attempt to test the truth of a religion by an ethical and
moral standard."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Now that is precisely the opposite of
the Deuteronomic attitude. Israel is encouraged and
incited to right action by having it pointed out that not
only experience, not only Divinely given statutes and
judgments, but the very nature of man itself guarantees
the truth of this supreme law of love. The law laid upon
men is nothing strange to, or incongruous with, their own
better selves. It is the very thing which their hearts have
cried out for; when it is proclaimed the higher nature in
man recognises it and bows before it. It is not received
because of fear, nor is it bowed before because it is
backed by power which can smite men to the dust. No;
even in its ruins human nature is nobler than that; and
Deuteronomy everywhere teaches with burning conviction
that God is too ethical and spiritual in nature to accept the
submission of a slave.</p>

<p>This reading of our passage is plainly that which St.
Paul takes in Rom. x. 5 and 6. He perceives, what so
many fail to do, that the spirit and scope of the
Deuteronomic teaching are different from that of the purely
legal sections of the Pentateuch. Paul therefore quotes
the Pentateuch as having already made the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
between works and faith which he wishes to emphasise,
and as having distinctly given preference to the latter.
Leviticus, keeps men at the level of the worker for wages,
while Deuteronomy in this passage, by making love to
God the essence of all true observance of the law, raises
them almost to the level of sons. And just as in those
ancient days the highest manifestations of God had not
to be laboured for and sought by impotent strivings, but
had plainly been made known to them and had found an
echo in their hearts, so now the highest revelation had
been brought near to men in Christ, and had found a
similar response. They did not need to seek it in heaven,
for it had been brought to earth in the Incarnation. They
did not need to descend into the abyss, for all that was
needed had been brought thence by Christ at His resurrection.
And in the New Testament as in the Old, the
simplicity of the entrance into true relations with God
is emphasised. Love and faith are the fundamental
conditions. From them obedience will naturally issue,
since "to faith all things are possible, and to love all
things are easy."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3><i>THE SONG AND BLESSING OF MOSES</i></h3>

<h4>(A). <span class="smcap">The Song of Moses</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xxxii.</h4>


<p>Critics have debated the date, authorship, and history
of this song. For the present purpose it is
sufficient, perhaps, to refer to the statement on these
points in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>But in discussing the meaning and contents of the song
the differences referred to cause no difficulties. On any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
supposition the time and circumstances, whether assumed
as present, or actually and really present to the prophet's
mind, can clearly be identified as not earlier than those
of the Syrian wars. Accepted as dealing with that time,
this poem takes its place among the Psalms of that period.
Its subject is a very common one in Scripture: the goodness
of Yahweh to His people, and their unfaithfulness
to Him; His grief at their rebellion; His punishment
of them by heathen oppressors; and His turning in love
to them, along with His destruction of the nations who
had prematurely triumphed over the people of God.
Practically this is the burden of all the prophecies, as
indeed it may be said to be the burden of the whole Book
of Deuteronomy itself. Here it is stated and elaborated
with great poetic skill; but in the main, the essential
thought, there is little that has not already been
elucidated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards form the poem is among the finest specimens
of Hebrew literary art which the Old Testament contains.
Every verse contains at least two parallel clauses of three
words or word-complexes each, and the parallelism in the
great majority of instances is of the "Synonymous" kind;
that is to say, "the second line enforces the thought of the
first by repeating, and as it were <em>echoing</em> it in a varied
form."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> But into this as a foundation there is wrought a
great deal of pleasing variation. The two-clause verses are
varied by single instances or couplets or triplets of four-clause
verses; while in two cases, at the emphatic end of
sections, in vv. 14 and 39, the rare five-clause verse is
found. Further, the synonymous parallelism is relieved by
occasional appearances of the "synthetic" parallelism,
in which "the second line contains neither a repetition
nor a contrast to the thought of the first, but in different
ways supplements and completes it,"<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> <i>e.g.</i> vv. 8, 19, and 27.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>The contents of the song are in every way worthy
of the origin assigned to it, and higher praise than
that it is impossible to conceive. Beginning with a fine
exordium calling upon heaven and earth to give ear, the
inspired poet expresses the hope that his teaching may
fall with refreshing and fertilising power upon the hearts
of men, for he is about to proclaim the name of Yahweh,
to whom all greatness is to be ascribed. In vv. 4 ff. the
character and dealings of Yahweh are set over against
those of the people:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Rock! His deeds are perfect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all His ways are judgment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A God of faithfulness and without falsity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just and upright is He."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">They, on the contrary, were perverse and crooked; and,
acting corruptly, they requited all Yahweh's benefits with
rebellion. To win them from that perverseness, he calls
upon his people to look back upon the whole course of
God's dealings with them. Even before Israel had appeared
among the nations, Yahweh had taken thought for His
people. When He assigned their lands to the various
nations of the world He had always before Him the provision
that must be made for the children of Israel, and had
left a space for them from which none but Yahweh could
ever drive them out. For He had the same need of and
delight in His people as the nations had in the lands
assigned to them, the lot of their inheritance. And not
only had He thus prepared a place for Israel from the
beginning, but He had led him through the wilderness,
through "the waste, the howling desert."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He compassed him about, He cared for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kept him as the apple of His eye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">To depict the Divine care worthily, he ventures upon a
simile of a specially tender kind, rare in the Old Testament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
but to which our Lord's comparison of His own brooding
affection for Jerusalem to that of a "hen gathering her
chickens under her wing" is parallel.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As an eagle stirs up her nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flutters above her young;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, Yahweh, spread abroad His wings, He took him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bore him upon His pinions."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">All the hardship and the toil were of God's appointment
to drive His beloved people upwards and onwards.
Whatever they might think or believe now, it was
Yahweh alone, without companion or ally, who had done
this for them, borne them up through it, and had bestowed
upon them all the luxury of the goodly land once promised
to their fathers. Even from the rocks He had given them
honey, and the rocky soil had produced the olive tree.
They had, too, all the luxuries of a pastoral people in
abundance, and the wheat and foaming wine which were
the finest products of agriculture.</p>

<p>In every way their God had blessed them. They had
all the prosperity which a complete fulfilment of the will
of God could have brought, but the result of it all was
unfaithfulness and rejection of Him. Jeshurun, the upright
people, as the sacred singer in bitter irony calls
Israel, waxed fat and wanton. Instead of being drawn to
God by His benefits, they had been puffed up with conceit
concerning their own power and discernment. Full of
these, they had mingled idolatrous rites with their worship
of Yahweh. He had suffered them to reap the results of
their own unfaithfulness in defeat at the hands of their
foes.</p>

<p>Instead of seeking the cause of their ill-success in
themselves, they had found it in the weakness of their
God. All the victories Yahweh had given them over foes
whose strength they had feared were forgotten, and they
"despised the Rock of their salvation." They had adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
new and upstart deities whom their fathers had never
heard of, who as they had come up in a day might
disappear in a day, and neglected the Rock who begat
them.</p>

<p>Yahweh on His part saw all this, and scorned His
people and their doings. In a vivid imaginative picture
the poet represents Him as resolving to hide His face
from them, to see what their end would be. Without the
shining of God's countenance there could be but one issue
for a people who were so faithless and perverse. He will
recompense them for their doings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They made Me jealous with a no-God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They vexed Me with their vain idols,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will make them jealous with a no-people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a foolish nation will I vex them."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">For the fire of Divine wrath is kindled against them.
It burns in Yahweh with an all-consuming power, and
fills the universe even to the lowest depths of Sheol.
Upon this sinful people it is about to burst forth; Yahweh
will exhaust all His arrows upon them. By famine and
drought; by disease and the rage of wild beasts, and
of "the crawlers of the dust"; by giving them up to
their enemies, and by overwhelming them with terror. He
will destroy this people, "the young man and the virgin,
the suckling and the man of grey hairs" alike. Nothing
could save them, save Yahweh's respect for His own
name.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I had said, I shall blow them away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall make their memory to cease from among men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it not that I feared vexation from the enemy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest their adversaries should misdeem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest they should say, <em>Our</em> hand is exalted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Yahweh hath not done all this."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Nothing but that stood between them and utter destruction,
for as a nation they had no capacity for receiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
and profiting by instruction. If they had been wise they
would have known that there was but a step between
them and death; they would have seen that their deeds
had separated them from Yahweh, and could have but
one issue. Their frequent and shameful defeats should
have taught them that, for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How could one chase a thousand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two put to flight ten thousand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it not that their Rock had sold them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that Yahweh had delivered them up?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">There was no possible explanation of Israel's defeats
but this; for neither in the gods of the heathen nor in
the heathen nations themselves was there anything to
account for them. Their gods were not comparable to
the Rock of Israel; even Israel's enemies knew as much
as that. Israel might forget and doubt Yahweh's power,
but those who had been smitten before Him in Israel's
happier days knew that He was above all their gods.
Nor was the explanation to be sought in the heathen
nations themselves. For they were not vines of Yahweh's
planting, but shoots from the vine of Sodom, tainted by
the soil of Gomorrah. They were, perhaps, in race, of
the old Canaanite stock; in any case they were morally
and spiritually related to them, and their acts were such
as brought death and destruction with them. In themselves,
consequently, they could not have been strong
enough to discomfit the people of God as they were doing,
nor could they have been helped to that by any favour of
His. Only the determination of Yahweh to chastise His
people could explain Israel's unhappy fate in war.</p>

<p>But Yahweh's purpose was only to chastise. He was
in no way finally forgetful of His chosen, nor of the
ineradicable evil of their enemies' nature. The inner
character of men and things is always present to Him,
and their deeds are laid up with Him as that which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
be dealt with, for it is one of the glories of Deity to sweep
evil away and to restore anything that has good at its
heart. Recompense is God's great function in the world,
and evil, however strong it may be, and however long it
may triumph, must one day be dealt with by Him. It
is laid up and sealed</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Against the day of vengeance and of recompense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the time when their foot shall slip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the day of their calamity is at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hastening are the things prepared for them."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Without that, justice could never be done to the people
of God; and justice should be done to them when they
had been brought to the verge of extinction, when,
according to the antique Hebrew phrase, there "was
none fettered or set free," none left under or over age.
Then when all but the worst had come, Yahweh would
demand, "Where are their gods, with whom they took
refuge, and who have eaten the fat of their sacrifices, and
drunk the wine of their drink offerings?" He will
challenge them to arise and help in this last disastrous
state of their votaries.</p>

<p>But there will be no response, and it will be made clear
beyond all doubting that Yahweh alone is God. He will
declare Himself, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See now that I, I, am He,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is no god with Me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>I</em> kill, and <em>I</em> make alive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wound, and I heal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is none that delivereth out of My hand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">In that great day of Yahweh's manifested glory He will
stand forth in the fulness of avenging power. Before
the universe He will pledge Himself by the most solemn
oath to bring down the pride of His enemies. In a
death-dealing judgment, such as is seen only when the
evil elements in the world have brought about a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
carnival of wickedness, and only universal death can
cleanse, He will recompense upon evil-doers the evil they
have wrought, and to a renovated world bring peace.
There are few finer or more impressive imaginative
passages in Scripture than this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For I lift up My hand to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say, (As) I live for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I whet My gleaming sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And My hand take hold on judgment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will take vengeance upon Mine enemies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will recompense them that hate Me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will make Mine arrows drunk with blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And My sword shall devour flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the blood of the slain and the captives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the chief of the leaders of the enemy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">With this great vision of judgment the poet leaves his
people. For them the first necessity evidently was that
they should be assured that Yahweh reigned, that evil
could not ultimately prosper. With their whole horizon
dominated and illumined by this tremendous figure of the
ever living and avenging God, their faith in the moral
government of the world and in the ultimate deliverance
of their nation would be restored.</p>

<p>The poem closes with a stanza in which the seer and
singer calls upon the nations to rejoice because of
Yahweh's people. The deliverance worked for them will
be so great and so memorable that even the heathen who
see it must rejoice. They will see His justice and His
faithfulness, and will gain new confidence in the stability
and the moral character of the forces which rule the
world.</p>


<h4>(B) <span class="smcap">The Blessing of Moses</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xxxiii.</h4>

<p>Besides the farewell speeches and the farewell song,
we have in this chapter yet another closing utterance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
attributed to Moses. Here, as in the case of the song, we
relegate critical matters to the note below.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>We must notice in the first place the remarkable
difference in tone and outlook between the blessing
and the song of Moses. In the latter evil-doing and
approaching judgment are the burden; here the outward
and inward condition of Israel leaves little to be desired.
Satisfaction is breathed in every line, for both temporally
and spiritually the state of the people is almost ideally
happy. Nowhere is there a shadow; even on the
horizon there is scarcely a cloud. Now even an optimist
would need a background of actual prosperity to draw
such a picture of idyllic happiness for any nation, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
may therefore conclude that the poem has in view one of
the few halcyon periods of Israel, before social wrongs
had ruined the yeomen farmers, or war and conquest had
corrupted the powerful. The nation is as yet faithful to
Yahweh, and possesses in peace the land which He had
given them to inherit.</p>

<p>The central part of the poem is of course the ten
blessings promised to the various tribes, but these are
preceded by an introduction (vv. 2-5), in which the formation
of the people is traced to Yahweh's revelation of
Himself and His coming forth as their King. They are
followed also by a concluding section (vv. 26-29), in
which the God of Jeshurun is declared to be incomparable,
and His people are depicted as supremely happy under His
protecting care. The language is in parts obscure, and
though the general scope is always plain, yet there are
verses the meaning of which can only be conjectured.
This is especially the case in the introduction. Of the
five lines of ver. 2, the fourth and fifth as they stand are
hardly intelligible; the fifth indeed is not intelligible at all.
In ver. 3 again, while the first and second clauses are
fairly clear, the third and fourth are as they stand untranslatable.
But the general signification of the introductory
verses (2-5) is that the Divine revelation of
Himself which Yahweh bestowed upon His people as He
came with them from Sinai, Paran, and Seir through the
wilderness, and the establishment of the covenant which
made Yahweh Israel's King, together with the bestowal of
an inheritance upon them, is the foundation and beginning
of that happiness which is to be described. It is all traced
back to the "dawning" of God upon them, His "shining
out" upon them from Sinai, and Seir, and Paran. These
are named simply as the most prominent points in that
region whence the people came out into Canaan, and
where the great revelation had been bestowed. God had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
risen like the sun and had shed forth light upon them
there, so that they walked no more in darkness. The
sight of God was, on this view, the great and fundamental
fact in the history of the chosen people. They, like all
who have seen that great sight, were henceforth separate
from others, with different duties and obligations, with
hopes and desires and joys unknown to all beside. And
the ground of this condescension on the part of God was
His love for His people. He loved them, and the saints
among them were upheld by Him. By Moses He gave
them a law, which was to hold from generation to generation;
and He had crowned His gifts to them by becoming
their King when the heads of the people entered into
covenant with Him.</p>

<p>Then follow the blessings, beginning with good wishes
for Reuben as the firstborn. But the tribe is not highly
favoured. It is however less severely dealt with than in
Jacob's blessing. There instability and obscurity are
foretold of it. Here it would seem as if the fortunes of
the tribe were at the lowest ebb, and a wish is expressed
that it may not be suffered to die out. From the earliest
times the tribe of Reuben seems to have been tending to
decay. At the first census taken under Moses the
number of Reubenites capable of bearing arms was
46,500 men (Numb. i. 21), at the second 43,730 (Numb.
xxvi. 7). Both passages are from P, and consequently
this decadence of the tribe must have been present to that
author's mind. In David's day they had still possession
of part of their heritage, but even then their best estate
was past. They had allowed many Moabites to remain
in the territory they conquered. These most certainly
caused trouble and gained the upper hand in places, until
before the days of Mesa, king of Moab, as we learn from
his inscription,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> a great part of the cities formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
Reubenite were in Moabite or Gadite hands. In Isaiah
xv. and xvi. again, Heshbon and Elealeh, cities still
Reubenite in Mesa's day, appear as Moabite, so that the
bulk of the territory assigned to the tribe must have been
lost.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> This record confirms the view that the blessing
was written between Rehoboam and Jehoshaphat, and
throws light upon our verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"May Reuben live, and not die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that his men be few."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The blessing of Judah follows, but in contrast with the
great destiny foretold for this tribe in Jacob's blessing
what is here said is strangely short and unenthusiastic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hear, O Yahweh, Judah's voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring him to his people;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his hands has he striven for it (his people);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a help against his enemies be thou."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Some whose opinions we are bound to respect, as Oettli,
think this refers merely to Judah's being appointed to lead
the van of the invasion, as in Judges i. 1 and xx. 8.
In that case we should have to conceive that on some
occasion Judah was absent leading the conquest, and got
into dangerous circumstances, which are here referred to.
But it would seem that any such temporary danger could
hardly have a place here. In all the other blessings
permanent conditions only are regarded; and the sole
historical fact we really know that would explain this
reference is the division of the kingdom. But, it may be
said, all critics agree that the author of the blessing is a
Northern Israelite: now we cannot suppose a Northern
man to speak in this way of Judah, for it was the ten
tribes that revolted from the house of David, not Judah
from them. We must remember, however, that though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
that is how Scripture, which in this matter represents the
Southern view, regards the matter, the Northern Israelites
could look at the separation from another standpoint.
To those even who were favourable to the Davidic house,
and regretted the folly of Rehoboam, it might seem
that Judah had first broken away from the kingdom as
united under Saul; and the revolt under Jeroboam
would appear to be only a resumption of the older state
of things, from which Judah had again separated itself.
What circumstance can be referred to in the request to
hear Judah's voice cannot now be ascertained; but it is
not at all unlikely that some indication of a wish for
reunion, perhaps expressed in some public prayer, may
have been given in the first period of the separation.
The rest of the verse would fit this hypothesis as well as
it fits the other, and I think with the light we at present
have we must hold the reference to be as suggested.</p>

<p>With the eighth verse the blessing of Levi (one of the
two most heartfelt and sympathetic) begins. In it Yahweh
is addressed thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy Urim and thy Thummim be to the men (<i>i.e.</i> tribe) of thy devoted one (<i>i.e.</i> Moses or Aaron),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thou didst prove at Massah,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">In the last lines the relative pronoun is ambiguous, as
it may refer either to "men," for which in Hebrew we
have the collective singular '<i>ish</i>, or to "thy devoted one."
The last is the more probable; but in either case there
is a superficial discrepancy here between the historical
books and this statement. In Exod. xvii. 1-7, as well
as in Deuteronomy itself, it is the people who strove with
Moses and proved or tempted Yahweh. On this account
some would have us believe that a different account of the
events at Massah and Meribah was in this writer's mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
But that is the result of a mere itch for discovering discrepancies.
It lies in the very nature of the case that
there should be another side to it. The beginning was
with the people; but just as the wandering in the wilderness
is said to have been meant by God to prove Israel,
so this insubordination of the people was meant to prove
Moses or Aaron, and their failure to stand the proof made
Yahweh strive with them. The verse, then, founds Levi's
claim to possess the chief oracle and to instruct Israel
first of all upon their connection with Moses or Aaron, or
both, since they had been exceptionally tried and had
proved their devotion. The next verse, then, goes on
to found it also on the faithfulness of the Levites, when
they were called upon by Moses (Exod. xxxii. 26-29)
to punish the people for their worship of the golden calf.
In vv. 27 and 29 of that chapter we find the same phrases,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">9 "Who (<i>i.e.</i> the tribe) said unto his father and to his mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have not seen him;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who recognised not his brother, and would know nought of his son;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For they kept Thy commandment,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kept guard over Thy covenant."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Being such&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">10 "Let them teach Jacob Thy judgments,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And Israel Thy Torah;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Let them put incense in Thy nostrils,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And whole burnt-offerings upon Thine altars."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Here we have the whole priestly duties assigned to the
Levites. They are to perform judicial functions; to give
Torah, or instruction, by means of the Urim and Thummim
and otherwise; to offer incense in the Holy Place, and
sacrifices in the court of the Temple. As early as this,
therefore (on any supposition we need regard, long before
Deuteronomy), we find the Levites fully established as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
the priestly tribe. Before the earliest writing prophets
this was so&mdash;a fact of the greatest importance for the
history of Israelite religion. The remaining verse beseeches
Yahweh to accept the work of Levi's hands, and to smite
down his enemies. Evidently when this was written
special enmity was being shown to this tribe; and, as
has been said already, the religious proceedings of
Jeroboam I. would be sufficient to call forth such a cry
to Yahweh.</p>

<p>In ver. 12 the tribe of Benjamin is dealt with, and it
is depicted as specially blessed by the Divine favour and
the Divine presence. Yahweh covers him all the day
long, and dwells between his shoulders. There can
hardly be a doubt that the reference is to the situation
of the Temple at Jerusalem, on the hill of Zion, towards
the loftier boundary of Benjamin's territory.</p>

<p>Verses 13-17 contain the blessing of Joseph, <i>i.e.</i> of the
two tribes Ephraim and Manasseh.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">13 "Blessed of Yahweh be his land<br /></span>

<span class="i3">These (<i>i.e.</i> thus blessed) are the myriads of Ephraim,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="noind">Supreme fertility is to be his, and the favour of Yahweh is
to rest upon him as the kingly tribe in Israel. The curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
phrase at the beginning of the seventeenth verse has been
supposed to be a reference to some individual, Joshua,
Jeroboam II., or to the Ephraimite kings as a whole.
But the subject of the blessing is the Josephite tribes, and
there seems to be no good reason why the reference
should be changed here. It cannot, therefore, refer to less
than a whole tribe, and as according to Gen. xlviii. 14
Ephraim received the blessing of the firstborn, it must
be Ephraim which is Joseph's firstborn ox. This view
is confirmed by the last clause of the verse, in which the
myriads of Ephraim are spoken of, and only the thousands
of Manasseh. Obviously this must refer to times like
those of Omri, when the Israelite kingship was in its first
youthful energy, and was extending conquest on every
hand.</p>

<p>The benedictions which remain are addressed to
Zebulun, Issachar, Gad, Dan, Naphtali, and Asher. They
need little comment beyond close translation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">18 "And of Zebulun he said,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">And the hidden treasures of the sand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The territory of Zebulun stretched from the Sea of
Galilee to the Mediterranean, probably quite down to
the sea near Akko, in any case near enough to give it an
active share in the sea traffic. Issachar, whose tribal land
was the plain of Esdraelon, also shares in it; but the
contrast between "thy going out" and "thy tents"
implies that Zebulun took the more active part in the
traffic. The reference in verse 19, clauses <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, is
obscure. As the Septuagint reads "they shall destroy"
instead of "unto the mountain," the text may be corrupt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
It may perhaps be an allusion to the sacrificial feasts at
inaugurated fairs to which surrounding peoples were
called, as Stade suggests.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3><i>MOSES' CHARACTER AND DEATH</i></h3>


<p>It has been often said, and it has even become a
principle of the critical school, that the historical
notices in the earlier documents of the Old Testament
represent nothing but the ideas current at the time
when they were written. Whether they depict an
Abraham, a Jacob, or a Moses, all they really tell us is
the kind of character which at such times was held to be
heroic. In this way the value of the historic parts of
Deuteronomy have been called in question, and we have
been told that all we can gather from them about Moses
is the kind of character which the pious, in the age of
Manasseh, would feel justified in attributing to their great
religious hero. But it is manifestly unfair to estimate the
statements of men who write in good faith, as if they were
only projecting their own desires and prejudices upon a
past which is absolutely dark. It may be true that such
writers might be unwilling to narrate stories concerning the
great men of the past which were inconsistent with the
esteem in which they were held; but it is much more
certain that their narratives will represent the tradition and
the current knowledge of their time regarding the heroes of
their race. Unless this be true, no reliance could be placed
upon anything but absolutely contemporary documents;
even these would be open to suspicion, if the human mind
were so lawless as to have no scruple in filling up all gaps
in its knowledge by imaginations. We must protest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
therefore, against the notion that what J and E and D
tell us concerning the life and character of Moses must be
discounted in any effort we make to represent to ourselves
the life and thought of that great leader of Israel. They
tell us much more than what was thought fitting for a
leader of the people in the ninth and eighth and seventh
centuries <small>B.C.</small> They tell us what was <em>believed</em> in those
times about Moses; and much of what was believed about
him must have rested upon good authority, upon entirely
reliable tradition, or upon previous written narratives
concerning him.</p>

<p>Up till recently it was held, by men as eminent even as
Reuss, that writing was unknown in the days of Moses,
and that for long afterwards oral tradition alone could
be a source of knowledge of the past. But recent discoveries
have shown that this is an entire mistake. Long
before Moses writing was a common accomplishment in
Canaan; and it seems almost ridiculous to suppose that
the man who left his mark so indelibly upon this nation
should have been ignorant of an art with which every
master of a village or two was thoroughly conversant.
Moreover the fact that the same root (<i>k-t-b</i>) occurs in
every Semitic tongue with the meaning "to write," would
seem to indicate that before their separation from one
another the art of writing was known to all the Semitic
tribes. The new facts enormously strengthen that probability,
and make the arguments advanced by those who
hold the opposite view look even absurd. But if writing
were known and practised in Moses' day in Canaan, it
would be marvellous if many of the great events of the
early days had not been recorded. It would be still
more marvellous if the comparatively late writings, which
alone we have at our disposal had not embodied and
absorbed much older documents.</p>

<p>But for still another reason the critical dictum must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
held to be false. Applied in other fields and in regard to
other times, this same principle would deprive us of almost
every character which has been considered the glory of
humanity. Zarathustra and Buddha have alike been
sacrificed to this prejudice, and there are men living who
say that we know so little about our Lord Jesus Christ
that it is doubtful whether He ever existed. A method
which produces such results <em>must</em> be false. The great
source of progress and reform has always been some man
possessed by an idea or a principle. Even in our own
days, when the press and the facilities for communication
have given general tendencies a power to realise themselves
which they never had in the world's history before,
great men are the moving factors in all great changes. In
earlier ages this was still more the case. It is an utterly
unjustifiable scepticism which makes men contradict the
grateful recollection of mankind, in regard to those who
have raised and comforted humanity. Through all
obscurities and confusions we can reach that Indian Prince
for whom the sight of human misery embittered his own
brilliant and enjoyable life. We refuse to give up
Zarathustra, though his story is more obscure and
entangled than that of almost any other great leader of
mankind. Especially in a history like that of Israel,
which purports to have been guided in a special manner
by revelations of the will of God, the individual man
filled with God's spirit is quite indispensable. Even if
mythical elements in the story could be proved, that would
not shake our faith in the existence of Moses; for as
Steinthal, who holds the very "advanced" opinion that
solar myths have strayed into the history of Moses, wisely
says, it is quite as possible to distinguish between the
mythical and the historical Moses as it is to distinguish
between the historical Charlemagne and the mythical.
Because of the general reliability of tradition regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
great men therefore, and because also of the proofs we
have that writing was common before Moses' day, we need
not burden ourselves with the assumption or the fear that
the Deuteronomic character of Moses may be unreliable.</p>

<p>But in endeavouring to set forth this conception of the
character of Moses, we cannot confine ourselves to what
appears in this book. It is generally acknowledged that
the author had at least the Yahwist and the Elohist
documents in their entirety before him, and regarded them
with respect, not to say reverence. Consequently we must
believe that he accepted what they said of Moses as true.
The only document in the Pentateuch that he may not
have known in any shape was the Priest Codex, but that
makes no attempt to depict the inner or outer life of Moses.
All the personal life and colour in the Biblical narrative
belongs to the other sources. For a personal estimate,
therefore, we lose little by excluding P. Only one other
cause of suspicion in regard to the historical parts of
Deuteronomy <em>could</em> arise. If it, comparatively modern as
it is, contained much that was new, if it revealed aspects
of character for which no authority was quoted, and of
which there was no trace in the earlier narratives, there
might be reasonable doubt whether these new details were
the product of imagination. But there is very little more
in Deuteronomy than there is in the historical parts of the
other books, though the older narratives are repeated with
a vivid and insistive pathos which almost seems to make
them new.</p>

<p>Combining then what the Deuteronomist himself says
with what the Yahwist and Elohist documents contain, we
find that the claim usually made for Moses, that he was
the founder of an entirely new religion, is not sustained.
Again and again it is asserted that Yahweh had been the
God of their fathers, of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&mdash;so
that Moses was simply the renewer of a higher faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
which for a time had been corrupted. Some have even
asserted that there had been all down the ages to Moses
the memory of a primeval revelation. But if there ever
was such a thing, we learn from Josh. xxiv. 2, a verse
acknowledged to be from the Elohist, that that "fair
beginning of a time" had been entirely eclipsed, for
Terah, the father of Abraham, had served other gods
beyond the flood. Abraham, therefore, rather than Moses,
is regarded as the founder of the religion of Yahweh.
Whether the word Yahweh (Exod. vi. 3) was known or not
makes little difference, for all our four authorities teach
that Moses' work was the revival of faith in that which
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had believed. But the bulk
of the people would appear to have been ignorant regarding
the God of their fathers; and probably the conception
which Deuteronomy shares with J and E is that in
Moses' day Yahweh was the special God of a small circle,
perhaps of the tribe of Levi, among whom a more spiritual
conception of God than was common among their countrymen
had either been retained, or had arisen anew.
Probably then we ought to conceive the circumstances of
Moses' early life somewhat in this way. A number of
Semitic tribes, more or less nearly related to each other
and to Edom and Moab, had settled in Egypt as semi-agricultural
nomads. At first they were tolerated; but
they were now being worn down and oppressed by forced
labour of the most brutal sort. Either a tribe or a clan
among them had the germs of a purer conception of God,
and in this tribe or clan Moses, the deliverer of his
people, was born. Providentially he escaped the death
which awaited all Israelite boys in those days, and grew
up in the camp of the enemies of his people. By this
means he received all the culture that the best of the
oppressors had, while the tie to Israel was neither
obscured nor weakened in his mind. At the court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Pharaoh he could not fail to acquire some notions of
state-craft, and he must have seen that the first step
towards anything great for his people must be their union
and consolidation. But his earliest effort on their behalf
showed that he had not really considered and weighed the
magnitude of his task. Killing an Egyptian oppressor
might conceivably have served as a signal for revolt.
But in point of fact it frustrated any plans Moses might
have had for the good of his people, and drove him into
the wilderness. Here the germs of various thoughts
which education and experience of life had deposited in
his mind had time to develop and grow. According to
the narrative, it was only at the end of his long sojourn
in Midian that he had direct revelation from God. But
amid the wide and awful solitudes of that wilderness land,
as General Gordon said of himself in the kindred solitudes
of the Soudan, he learned himself and God. Whatever
deposits of higher faith he had received from his family,
no doubt the long, silent broodings inseparable from a
shepherd's life had increased and vivified it. Every
possible aspect of it must have been reckoned with, all
its consequences explored; and his great and solitary soul,
we may be sure, had many a time let down soundings
into the deeps which were, as yet, dark to him. And
then&mdash;for it is to souls that have yearned after Him in
the travail of intellectual and spiritual longing that God
gives His great and splendid revelations&mdash;Yahweh revealed
Himself in the flame of the bush, and gave him the final
assurance and the first impulse for his life's work. It is
a touch of reality in the narrative which can hardly be
mistaken, that it represents Moses as shrinking from the
responsibility which his call must lay upon him. Behind
the few and simple objections in the narrative, we must
picture to ourselves a whole world of thoughts and
feelings into which the call of God had brought tumult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
and confusion. One would need to be a dry-as-dust
pedant not to see here, as in the case of Isaiah's call,
the triumphant issue of a long conflict and the decisive
moment of a victory over self, which had had already
many stages of defeat and only partial success. It is
perennially true to human nature and to the Divine
dealings with human nature, that help from on high
comes to establish and touch to finer issues that which
the true man has striven for with all his powers.</p>

<p>Enlightened and assured by this great revelation of
God, Moses left the quiet of the desert to undertake an
extraordinarily difficult task. He had to weld jealous
tribes into a nation; he had to rouse men whose courage
had been broken by slavery and cruelty to undertake a
dangerous revolt; and he had to prepare for the march of
a whole population, burdened with invalids and infants,
the feeble and the old, through a country which even
to-day tries all but the strongest. These things had to be
done; and the mere fact that they were accomplished
would be inexplicable, without the domination of a great
personality inspired by great ideas of a religious kind.
For, in antiquity, the only bond able to hold incongruous
elements together in one nationality was religion. With
the people whom Moses had to lead the necessity would
be the same, or even greater. But the political work
which must have preceded any common action likewise
demanded a great personality. Though no doubt a
common misery might silence jealousies and make men
eager to listen to any promises of deliverance, yet many
troublesome negotiations must have been carried through
successfully before these sentences could have been written
with truth: "And Moses and Aaron went and gathered
together all the elders of the children of Israel, and the
people believed, and bowed their heads and worshipped."</p>

<p>Many conjectures have been hazarded as to what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
centre of Moses' message at this time really was. Some,
like Stade, bring it down to this, that Yahweh was the God
of Israel. Others add to this somewhat meagre statement
another equally meagre, that Israel was the people of
Yahweh. But unless the character of Yahweh had been
previously expounded to the people, there seems little in
these two declarations to excite any enthusiasm or to
kindle faith. The mere fact of inducing the tribes to put
all other gods aside is insufficient to account for any of
the results that followed, if to Moses Yahweh had remained
simply a tribal God, of the same type as the gods
of the Canaanites. On the other hand, if he had risen to
the conception of God as a spirit, of Yahweh as the only
living God, as the inspirer and defender of moral life, or
even if he had made any large approach to these conceptions,
it is easy to understand how the hearts of the mass
of the people were stirred and filled, even though things
so high were not, by the generality, thoroughly understood
or long retained. But the hearts of all the chosen, the
spiritually elect, would be moved by them as the leaves
are moved by the wind. These, with Moses at their
head, formed a nucleus which bore the people on through
all their trials and dangers, and gradually leavened the
mass to some extent with the same spirit.</p>

<p>Even after this had been accomplished, the main work
remained to be done. We cannot agree indeed with many
writers who seem to think that the whole life of the
Israelite people was started anew by Moses. That would
involve that every regulation for the most trivial detail of
ordinary life was directly revealed, and that Moses made a
<i>tabula rasa</i> of their minds, rubbing out all previous laws
and customs, and writing a God-given constitution in their
place. Obviously, that could hardly be; but still a task
very different, yet almost as difficult, remained for Moses
after his first success. His final aim was to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
virtually new nation out of the Hebrew tribes; and their
whole constitution and habits had, consequently, to be
revised from the new religious standpoint. He and the
nation alike had inherited a past, and it was no part of
his mission to delete that. Reforms, to be stable, must
have a root in the habits and thoughts of the people
whom they concern. Moses would, consequently, uproot
nothing that could be spared; he would plant nothing
anew which was already flourishing, and was compatible
with the new and dominant ideas he had introduced.
A great mass of the laws and customs of the Hebrews
must have been good, and suitable to the stage of moral
advancement they had reached before Moses came to
them. Any measure of civilised life involves so much
as that. Another great mass, while lying outside of the
religious sphere, must have been at least compatible with
Yahwism. All laws and customs coming under these two
categories, Moses would naturally adopt as part of the
legislation of the new nation, and would stamp them with
his approval as being in accord with the religion of
Yahweh. They would thus acquire the same authority
as if they were entirely new, given for the first time by
the Divinely inspired lawgiver.</p>

<p>But besides these two classes of laws and customs
there must have been a number which were so bound up
with the lower religion that they could not be adopted.
They would either be obstructive of the new ideas, or they
would be positively hostile to them; for on any supposition
heathenism of various sorts was largely mingled with
the religion of the Israelite people before their deliverance,
and even after it. To sift these out, and to replace them
by others more in accord with the will of Yahweh as now
revealed, must have been the chief work of the lawgiver.
In that more or less protracted period before Israel came
to Sinai, during which Moses burdened himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
judging the people personally, he must have been doing
this work. His reflections in the wilderness had doubtless
prepared him for it. In a mind like his, the fruitful
principles received by the inspiration of the Almighty
could not be merely passively held. Like St. Paul in
his Arabian sojourn, we must believe that Moses in
Midian would work out the results of these principles in
many directions; and when he led Israel forth, he must
have been clearly conscious of changes that were indispensable.
But it needed close every-day contact with the
life of the people to bring out all the incompatibilities
which he would have to remove. Every day unexpected
complications would arise; and the people at any rate,
if Moses himself be supposed to be raised by his inspiration
above the needs of experience, would be able to
receive the instruction they needed only in concrete
examples, here a little and there a little. When they
came to "seek Yahweh" in any matter which perplexed
them, Moses gave them Yahweh's mind on the subject;
and each decision tended to purify and render innocuous
to their higher life some department of public or private
affairs. Every day at that early time must have been a
day of instruction how to apply the principles of the
higher faith just revived. The better minds among the
chiefs were thereby trained to an appreciation of the new
point of view; and when Jethro suggested that the burden
of this work should be divided, quite a sufficient number
were found prepared to carry it on. After this it must
have gone on with tenfold speed, and we may believe that
when Sinai was reached the preliminaries on the human
side to the great revelation had been thoroughly elaborated.
The Divine presence had been with Moses day by day,
judging, deciding, inspiring in all their individual concerns
as well as in their common affairs. But that would
only bring out more clearly the extent of the reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
that remained to be wrought; doubtless too it had
revealed the dulness of heart in regard to the Divine
which has always characterised the mass of men. The
need for a more complete revelation, a more extended and
detailed legislation on the new basis, must have been
greatly felt. In the great scene at Sinai, a scene so
strange and awe-inspiring that to the latest days of Israel
the memory of it thrilled every Israelite heart and exalted
every Israelite imagination, this need was adequately met.</p>

<p>In connection with it Moses rose to new heights of
intimacy with the Divine. What he had already done was
ratified, and in the Decalogue the great lines of moral and
social life were marked out for the people. But the most
remarkable thing to us, in the narrative of the circle of
events which made the mountain of the law for ever
memorable, is the sublimity attributed to the character of
Moses. From the day when he smote the Egyptian, at
every glimpse we have of him we find him always
advancing in power of character. The shepherd of
Midian is nobler, less self-assertive, more overawed by
communion with God, than the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
noble as he was. Again, the religious reformer, the
popular leader, who needs the very insistence of God to
make him lead, who speaks for God with such courageous
majesty, who teaches, inspires, and manages a turbulent
nation with such conspicuous patience, self-repression,
and success, is greatly more impressive than the Moses
of Midianite days. But it is here, at Sinai, that his rank
among the leaders of men is fixed for ever. To the
people of that time God was above all things terrible; and
when they came to the mount and found that "there were
thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount,
and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud," they could
only tremble. Their very fear made it impossible for
them to understand what God desired to reveal concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Himself. But in Moses love had cast out fear. Even
to him, doubtless, the darkness was terrible, because it
expressed only too well the mystery which enwrapped the
end of the Divine purposes of which he alone had seen
the beginnings; even his mind must have been clouded
thick with doubts as to whither Yahweh was leading him
and his people; yet he went boldly forth to seek God,
venturing all upon that errand.</p>

<p>In previous perplexities the narrative represents
Moses as calling instantly upon Yahweh; but now, when
experience had taught him the formidable nature of his
task, when difficulties had increased upon him, when his
perplexities of all kinds must have been simply overwhelming,
he heard the voice of Yahweh calling him to
Himself. Straightway he went into solitary communion
with Him; and when he passed with satisfied heart from
that communion, he brought with him those immortal words
of the Decalogue which, amid all changes since, have been
acknowledged to be the true foundation for moral and
spiritual life. He brought too a commission authorising
him to give laws and judgments to his people in accord
with what he had heard and seen on the mount. However
we are to understand the details of the narrative
therefore, its meaning is that at this time, and under these
circumstances, Moses attained his maximum of inspiration
as a seer or prophet, and from that time onward stood in
a more intimate relation to God than any of the prophets
and saints of Israel who came after him. He had found
God; and from where he stood with God he saw the paths
of religious and political progress plainly marked out.</p>

<p>Henceforth he was competent to guide the nation he
had made as he had not yet been, and with his power
to help them his eagerness to do so grew. Twice during
this great crisis of his life the people broke away into evil,
and national death was threatened. But with passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
supplications for their pardon he threw himself down
between God and them. At precisely the moment when
his communion with God was most complete, he rose to
the loving recklessness of desiring that if they were to be
destroyed he might perish with them. Strangely enough,
though the author of Deuteronomy had this before him,
he does not mention it. It cannot have struck even him
as the crowning point of Moses' career, as it does us.
Even in his day the fitness, nay, the necessity, of this self-sacrificing
spirit as the fruit of deeper knowledge of God,
was not yet felt; much less could it have been felt in the
days of the earlier historians. There must, therefore, be
reliable information here as to what Moses actually did.
Such love as this was not part of the Israelite ideal at the
time of our narrative, and from nothing but knowledge of
the fact could it have been attributed to Moses. We may
rank this enthusiasm of love, therefore, as a reliable trait
in his character. But if it be so, how far must he in his
highest moments have transcended his contemporaries, and
even the best of his successors, in knowledge of the
inmost nature of God! His thought was so far above
them that it remained fruitless for many centuries.
Jeremiah's life and death first prepared the way for its
appreciation, but only in the character of the Servant of
Yahweh in Second Isaiah is it surpassed. Now if in this
deepest part of true religion Moses possessed such exceptional
spiritual insight, it is vain to attempt to show that
his conception of God was so low, and his aim for man
so limited, as modern theorists suppose. The truth must
lie rather with those who, like Dr. A. B. Davidson,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> see
in him "a profoundly reverential ancient mind with
thoughts of God so broad that mankind has added little
to them. Nothing in the way of sublimity of view would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
be incongruous with such a character, while nothing could
be more grotesque than to shut it up within the limits of
the gross conceptions of the mass of the people. He was
their guiding star, not their fellow, in all that concerned
God, and his religious conceptions were by a whole heaven
removed from theirs. The entire tragedy of his life just
consisted in this, that he had to strive with a turbulent
and gainsaying people, had to bear with them and train
them, had to be content with scarcely perceptible advances,
where his strenuous guidance and his patient love should
have kindled them to <em>run</em> in the way of God's commandments.
But though their progress was lamentably slow,
he gave them an impulse they were never to lose. Under
the inspiration of the Almighty he so fixed their fundamental
ideas about God that they never henceforth could
get free of his spiritual company. In all their progress
afterwards they felt the impress of his mind, moulding
and shaping them even when they knew it not, and
through them he started in the world that redemptive
work of God which manifested its highest power in Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>From this point onward the idea of Moses that Deuteronomy
gives us is that of a great popular leader, meeting
with extraordinary calmness all the crises of government,
and guiding his people with unwavering steadfastness.
Without power, except that which his relation to God
and the choice of the people gave him, without any official
title, he simply dominated the Israelites as long as he
lived. And the secret of his success is plainly told us
in the narrative. He would not move a single step
without Divine guidance (Exod. xxxiii. 12): "And Moses
said unto the Lord, See, Thou sayest unto me, Bring up
this people: but Thou hast not let me know whom Thou
wilt send with me." (Ver. 14) "And He said, Must I go
in person with thee and bring thee to thy place of rest?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
And Moses said, If Thou dost not go with us in person,
then rather lead us not away hence." That can only mean
that he laid aside self-will, that he put away personal
sensitiveness, that he had learned to feel himself unsafe
when vanity or self-regard asserted themselves in his
decisions, that he sought continually that detachment of
view which absolute devotion to the Highest always gives.
It means also that he knew how dark and dull his own
vision was, that clouds and darkness would always be
about him, and that it would be impossible for him to
choose his path, unless he knew what the Divine plan for
his people was. And all that is narrated of him afterward
shows that his prayer was granted. His patience under
trial has been handed down to us as a marvel. Though
his brother and sister rebelled against him, he won them
again entirely to himself. Though a faction among
the people rose against his authority under Dathan and
Abiram, his power was not even shaken. Amid all the
perversity and childish fickleness of Israel he kept them
true to their choice of the desert, "that great and terrible
wilderness," as against Egypt with the flesh-pots. He
kept alive their faith in the promise of Yahweh to give
them a land flowing with milk and honey, and what was
more and greater than that, their faith in Him as their
Redeemer. By his intercourse with Yahweh he was
upheld from falling away from his own ideals, as so
many leaders of nations have done, or from despairing
of them.</p>

<p>The complaints and perversities of the people did however
force him into sin; and perhaps we may take it that
the outbreak of petulance when he smote the rock was
only one instance of some general decay of character on
that side, or perhaps one should rather say, of some
general falling away from the self-restraint which had
distinguished him. It seems strange that this one failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
should have been punished in him, by exclusion from the
land he had so steadfastly believed in, the land which
most of those who actually entered it would never have
seen but for him. And it is pathetic to find him among
that great company of martyrs for the public good, those
who in order to serve their people have neglected their
own characters. Under the stress of public work and the
pressure of the stupidity and greed of those whom they
have sought to guide, many leaders of men have been
tempted, and have yielded to the temptation, to forget
the demands of their better nature. But whatever their
services to the world, such unfaithfulness does not pass
unpunished. They have to bear the penalty, whosoever
they be; and Moses was no more an exception than
Cromwell or Savonarola was, to mention only some of
the nobler examples. He had been courageous when
others had faltered. He had been pre-eminently just;
for in founding the judicial system of Israel he had
guarded alike against the tyranny of the great and against
unjust favour to the small. He had laid a firm hand
upon the education of youth, determined that the best
inheritance of their people, the knowledge of the laws of
Yahweh and of His providences, should not be lost to
them. He had cleared their religion in principle of all
that was unworthy of Yahweh, and he had by resolute
valour, and by uncompromising sternness to enemies,
brought his great task to a successful issue. But the
reward of it all, the entrance into the land he had virtually
won for his people, was denied to him. It is one of the
laws of the Divine government of the world, that with
those to whom God specially draws near He is more
rigorous than with others. Amos clearly saw and proclaimed
this principle (Amos iii. 2). "Hear this word
that Yahweh hath spoken against you, children of Israel,"
he says; "You only have I known of all the families of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
earth: <em>therefore</em> I will visit upon you all your iniquities."
The pathetic picture of the aged lawgiver, judge, and
prophet, beseeching God in vain that he might share in
the joy which was freely bestowed upon so many less
known and less worthy than he, pushes home that strenuous
teaching. For his sin he died with his last earnest
wish unfulfilled, and it was sadly longing eyes that death's
finger touched. We remember also that, so far as we can
judge, he had no certain hope of a future life other than the
shadowy existence of Hades. "Though he slay me yet
will I trust him" had a much more tragic meaning for
Old Testament saints than it can ever have for us, for
whom Christ has brought life and immortality to light.
Yet, with a so much heavier burden, and with so much
less of gracious support, they played their high part.
That solitary figure on the mountain-top, about to die
with the fulfilment of his passionate last wish denied him
by his God, must shame us into silence when we fret
because our hopes have perished. All those nations
which have had that figure on their horizon have been
permanently enriched in nature by it. In a thousand
ways it has shot forth instructions; but, above all, it has
made men worthy in their own eyes; for it has been a
continuous reminder that God can and ought to be served
unfalteringly, even when the reward we wish is denied us,
and when every other consolation is dim.</p>

<p>But the question may now arise, Is not this character
of Moses which the author of Deuteronomy partly had
before him and partly helped to elaborate, too exalted to
be reliable? Can we suppose that a man in Moses' day
and circumstances could actually have entertained such
thoughts, and have possessed such a character as we have
been depicting? In essentials it would appear to be
quite possible. Putting aside all distracting questions
about details, and remembering that it is a mere superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
to suppose that the wants and appliances of
civilisation are necessary to loftiness of character and
depth of thought, where is there anything in the situation
of Moses which should make this view of him incredible?
No doubt there was a rudeness in his surroundings which
must necessarily have affected his nature; and the forms of
his thinking in that early, though by no means primitive,
time must have differed greatly from ours. Moreover,
as an instrument for scientific inquiry and for the
verification of facts, the human mind must have been
greatly less effective then than it is to-day. But none
of these things have much influence upon a man's capacity
to receive a new and inspiring revelation as to God.
Otherwise no child could be a Christian. As regards the
rudeness of his surroundings, we must not consciously or
unconsciously degrade him to the level of a modern
Bedouin. Among the host he led, some doubtless were
at that level; but the bulk of Israel must have been above
it; and Moses himself, from his circumstances and his
natural endowment, must have stood side by side with the
most cultured men of his time. Whatever ignorance or
error in science he may have been capable of, and however
rude, according to our ideas, his manner of life, there was
nothing in these to shut him out from spiritual truth.
That which Prof. Henry Morley has finally said of Dante<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
must have been true, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of a man like Moses.
"Dante's knowledge is the knowledge of his time," but
"if spiritual truth only came from right and perfect
knowledge, this would have been a world of dead souls
from the first to now, for future centuries in looking back
at us will wonder at the little faulty knowledge that we
think so much. But let the <em>known</em> be what it may, the
true soul rises from it to a sense of the Divine mysteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
of wisdom and love. Dante's knowledge may be full of
ignorance, and so is ours. But he fills it as he can with
the spirit of God." In the East this is even more conspicuously
true, even to this day. What an Israelite
under similar conditions might be is seen in the prophet
Amos. His external condition was of the poorest&mdash;a
gatherer of sycamore fruit must have been poor even for
the East&mdash;yet he knew accurately the history, not only of
his own people, but of the surrounding nations, and
brooded on the purpose of God in regard to his own
people and the world, till he became a fit recipient of
prophetic inspirations. But indeed the whole history of
Christianity is a demonstration of this truth. From the
first days, when "not many mighty, not many noble were
being called," when it was specially the message to listening
slaves, the religion of Christ has had its greatest
triumphs among the "poor of the world, rich in faith,"
but in nothing else. These have not only believed it, but
they have lived it, and amid the meanest and rudest
surroundings, with the most limited outlook, have built
up characters often of even resplendent virtue. Whatever
primitiveness we may fairly ascribe, therefore, to the life
and surroundings of Moses, that is no reason why we
should think it incredible that he had received lofty spiritual
truth from God. If he did such things for Israel as we
have seen, if, as almost all admit, he actually made a
nation, and planted the seeds of a religion of which Christianity
is the natural complement and crown, then the
view that he had a greatly higher idea of God than those
about him is not only credible but necessary. If his
teaching concerning Yahweh had amounted only to this,
that He was the only God Israel was to worship, and
that they were to be solely His people, then on such
a basis nothing more than the ordinary heathen civilisations
of the Semitic people could have been built. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
if he had the thought of God which is embodied in the
Decalogue, that could bring with it everything in the
character of Moses that seems too high for those early
days. The knowledge of God as a spiritual and moral
being could not fail to moralise and spiritualise the man.
The lofty conception of human duty, the submission to
the will of God, the passionate love for his nation which
made personal loss nothing to Moses, may well have been
evoked by the great truth which formed his prophetic
revelation.</p>

<p>But the narrative itself, considered merely as a history,
is of such a nature as to give confidence that it rests upon
some record of an actual life. Ideal sketches of great
men (setting aside the products of modern fictive art) are
much more uniform and superficially coherent than this
character of Moses. The purpose of the writer either to
exalt or to decry carries all before it, and we get from
such a source pictures of character so consistent that they
cannot possibly be true. Here, however, we have nothing
of that kind. Rashnesses and weaknesses are narrated,
and even Moses' good qualities are manifested in unexpected
ways in response to unexpected evils in the people.
The mere fact, also, that his grave was unknown is indicative
of truth. Though it would be absurd to say that
wherever we have the graves of great men pointed out,
there we have a mythical story, it is nevertheless true
that in the case of every name or character which has
come largely under the influence of the myth-making
spirit, the grave has been made much of. The Arabian
imagination here seems to be typical of the Semitic
imagination; and in all Moslem lands the graves of the
prophets and saints of the Old Testament are pointed out
with great reverence, even, or perhaps we should say
especially, if they be eighty feet long. Though a well-authenticated
tomb of Moses, therefore, would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
a proof of his real existence and life among men, the
absence of any is a stronger proof of the sobriety and
truth of the narrative. That with the goal in sight, and
with his great work about to come to fruition, he should
have turned away into the solitude of the mountains to
die, is so very unlikely to occur to the mind of the writer
of an ideal life of an ideal leader, that only some tradition
of this as a fact can account for it. The unexpectedness
of such an end to a hero's career is the strongest evidence
of its truth.</p>

<p>The result of all the indications is that the story of
Moses, as the author of Deuteronomy knew it, rests upon
authentic information handed down somehow, probably
in written documents, from the earliest time. Apart from
the question of inspiration, therefore, we may rest upon
it as reliable in all essentials. Only in him, and the
revelation he received, have we an adequate cause for
the great upheaval of religious feeling which shaped and
characterised all the after-history of Israel.</p>

criticism is. The non-observance of rites laid down as Divine commands,
and the appearance of ancient superstitions such as the worship of the
dead at any period, are held sufficient in the history of Israel to prove
that monotheism did not then exist, and that ancestor-worship was then
the prevailing cult. If applied to Islam that principle would lead to
utterly false conclusions. Is there any reason for thinking that it may
not give similar results when applied to the history of Israel?</p></div>

Deut. xxiv. 8, 9. This implies that the Levitical priests had special
duties in connection with such matters, duties which, if not precisely the
same as those laid down in the Law of Leprosy (Lev. xiii., xiv.), must have
nearly resembled them. Semi-medical skill must have been necessary
for the satisfactory discharge of these duties, and we must suppose that
the priests who discharged them were selected from the tribe of Levi
on some principle either of special proved knowledge and fitness, or
on the ground of hereditary devotion to such work.</p></div>

intricate, and it may be for ever impossible, from lack of data, to decide
at what period in Israelite history it originated, or whether it was ever
actually observed; but it undoubtedly expressed the spirit of the Israelite
legislation and customary law at all times. It is the natural culmination
of tendencies and ideas which were always present. That it is not
mentioned in Deuteronomy at all is surprising, if it had been previously
to Manasseh's day embodied either in custom or in law; yet, on the other
hand, there are references in Ezekiel and other exilic books which are
almost unintelligible except on the supposition that the jubilee year was
a perfectly well-known institution (cf. Jer. xxxiv. 8 ff.; Ezek. vii. 12 f.;
Ezek. xlvi. 16 ff.; Isa. lxi. 1 ff.). It is referred to in a merely allusive way,
which implies that every hearer or reader of the prophetic warnings
would know at once the full scope and meaning of the reference. Now,
had the jubilee year been unknown before the Exile, had it been introduced
by the author of Lev. xxv. just before Ezekiel, no such assumption
could have been made. It would, therefore, seem necessary to
suppose that the ordinance for a jubilee year must have existed in pre-exilic
time; for, strange as Deuteronomy's silence in regard to it is, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumentum e silentio</i> cannot weigh against indications of a positive kind,
were they even fainter than those we have in regard to this matter.</p></div>

prefer that their brother's property should be kept intact and be transmitted

<p><a name="Footnote_130_130" id="Footnote_130_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130_130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> The song is described, in the narrative framework, as delivered
through Moses to the children of Israel. On the other hand, internal
evidence points to a date after the establishment of the monarchy&mdash;when
the days of Moses and the events of the wilderness were old, when the
fruits of the land were gifts of God in present use, and when ingratitude
and rebellion had become conspicuous, so that judgment was
impending. Either, then, Moses took his stand, in the spirit, at a point
of time long subsequent to his own death, adapted the song to its circumstances,
and spoke not to his own generation but to one much later;
or a later prophet must be the writer. The objection to the former view
is supported by arguments drawn from various features in the language
and the allusions of the song, which are asserted to be indicative of the
later origin. On the detail of these we cannot dwell. But the most
interesting part of the argument is the position that the transference
of the prophetic consciousness to a remote future period, in order to
give hope and guidance to a generation not the prophet's own, is too
improbable to be admitted.
</p>
<p>
Such a process is now generally regarded as not impossible indeed,
but unheard of in the history of prophecy. The examination of the
prophets of the Old Testament has convinced students that the prophet's
vision starts from his own time, and is primarily for the comfort and
warning of his contemporaries. His words may have a more remote
reference, but must have the nearer one. Hence Isa. xl.-lxvi. is now
ascribed to a prophet or prophets of the Exile. The principle is really
the same as that which determines the authorship of Deut. xxxiv. 5-12.
No one now holds the view of some Jews, that Moses by the spirit of
prophecy wrote this himself. Yet if Moses could in a poem address his
people as sinning and suffering through rebellions induced by their
prosperity in Canaan, which they had not entered when he died, one
might as well believe him to describe his own decease. In both cases
we have to suppose the mind of Moses transported to a period when
he had been removed by death, that he might look back upon and speak
of events which when he wrote were still future. Now in both cases
a reason is lacking. Every one accepts the view that since Joshua or
Eleazar was there to write the account of Moses' death, it is unlikely
the lawgiver should have been inspired to write it himself. Just so,
since Yahweh inspired new prophets at every crisis of His people's
history, it seems unlikely that the spirit of Moses should be transferred
to, and made at home in, the circumstances of a distant generation, in
order to deliver to it a message which could have been made known by
a prophet to whom the time was present. Neither Kamphausen nor
Oettli nor Dillmann nor the English expositors who accept the non-Mosaic
authorship of the song have any doubt as to the supernatural
character of prophecy. They found upon observations as to the manner
of Old Testament prophecy, which ought to regulate interpretation.
</p>
<p>
According to critical views the ascription to Moses of the reception
and delivery of this song was taken by the Deuteronomist from JE.
Kautzsch supposes that an editor to whom the song was known as
passing under the name of Moses may have inserted it. Dillmann
suggests grounds for believing that several prayers and poems ascribed
to Moses (including Psalm xc.) were in circulation in prophetic circles
in the Northern Kingdom, and that this one of them was inserted here
as its appropriate place. The case would be parallel to the ascription
of various later Psalms to David. Compare also the discussions as to
the song of Hannah, 1 Sam. ii.
</p>
<p>
The view that a mistake as to the Mosaic authorship, for which the
writers of JE were not responsible, was handed on in perfect good
faith, is compatible with the doctrine of inspiration as held by representatives
of the orthodox Evangelical school in Germany, and by the newer
Evangelicals in England. Cf. Oettli, <cite>Deuteronomy</cite>, p. 22, and Sanday's
<cite>Bampton Lecture</cite>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_133_133" id="Footnote_133_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_133"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> The blessing of Moses was certainly not written by the author of
Deuteronomy: the vocabulary and the style are different from his. Nor
probably was the poem inserted here by him, but rather by the final
editor of the Pentateuch who is believed to have brought these closing
chapters into their present shape (cf. Chap. XXIV.). The authority on
which he relied may have been E.
</p>
<p>
As to the authorship of the blessing, Volck and Keil ascribe it to
Moses. The great majority of recent students regard it, at all events in
its present form, as post-Mosaic, on grounds drawn from features in the
poem, and from the principles of prophetic exegesis referred to in the note
(p. 452). Opinions differ much as to the date to be assigned, varying
from the time of David to that of Jeroboam II. The general assumption
is that the blessing is the work of a Northern Israelite; and the feeling
for the tribes of Levi and Judah which it embodies is the chief indication
on which a conjecture can be hazarded. That would agree with a date
later than Solomon and not later than Jehoshaphat&mdash;a period when many
in the Northern Kingdom still looked with reverence to the sanctuary at
Jerusalem, and when the Northern Levites still resented the intrusion by
Jeroboam of a mixed multitude into the priesthood.
</p>
<p>
As to form, and partly as to contents, the blessing of Moses is modelled
on the blessing of Jacob (Gen. xlix). One conspicuous difference is the
introduction into that before us of a prose heading before most of the
sections, analogous to the headings which appear in Arabic poetry (as
the <i>Hamasa</i>) before each quatrain or longer poem. There is no ground
for treating these as later insertions, nor for separating other portions, as
some have proposed, as later than the main composition.</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
